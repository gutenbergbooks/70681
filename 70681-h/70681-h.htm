<hr class="r5">

<p>This work comes from one in whose mind present Memories are
taking the place of early Hopes. It is specially addressed to those
in whose minds future Memories will soon take the place of present
Hopes. Hence a fitting occasion presents itself for the statement
of a few principles, by whose unerring guidance the exulting
Hopes of Youth may always be transformed into the happy Memories
of Age.</p>

<p>The Youth of all climes and times have a common attribute.
The desire of happiness is a universal desire. God fixes this element
in the core of life. Far back in our moral organization, before
human conduct can come in to control or modify, this longing for
happiness, this hope of future welfare, is radicated in the soul; so
that it seems to have been the first attribute which was taken for the
constitution of our nature, and around which the other attributes
were gathered, rather to have been added to the rest as a secondary
or incident. The desire of some form of happiness being secured,
as a motive power, it seems to have been left very much to the
option of each individual to select his own objects of enjoyment,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_iv">[Pg iv]</span>
whether noble or ignoble, and to devise his own means for obtaining
them, whether righteous or unrighteous.</p>

<p>The emulous and aspiring youth of a Free People will always
find much of their private, and most of their public welfare, indissolubly
connected with the institutions and laws of their country.
In these, therefore, their interest is both public and personal;—it
pertains to the citizen as well as to the man. All great moral
questions, though touching them but lightly at first, will come closer
and closer home, as long as they live;—growing into greater
importance for their posthumous memory than for their living
fame, and affecting the fortunes of their posterity even more than
their own.</p>

<p>Though all Young Men are substantially alike in their desire of
well being, yet, in regard to the guiding principles by which the
objects of hope are pursued, in order to obtain happiness, three
marked distinctions, or classes, exist among them.</p>

<p>1. There are those who adopt with implicit and unquestioning faith
the views of their parents, or of the circle, or caste, into which they
were thrown by the accident of birth. They never venture to explore
or wander outside of the ideas and opinions among which
they were born and bred. For them, an hereditary boundary encloses
thought, belief, hope. Whether the opinions amid which
they live are insular in their narrowness, or continental in their
breadth; whether they belong to the earth, came up from the
dark regions below, or descended from the realms of purity above,
they are taken into the receptive soul, as unfledged birds take whatever
food is offered them, from friend or foe, with closed eye and
opened mouth. Even if practically right, therefore, they are never
rationally right, for they have never discerned between good and ill;
and all their convictions, whether true or untrue, rest upon the
foundation of bigotry alone.</p>

<p>2. The second class look eagerly beyond family or caste. They
anxiously inquire what views, what dogmas, are in the ascendant<span class="pagenum" id="Page_v">[Pg v]</span>
among men,—what party predominates or outvotes, what avowals
or professions will most readily open avenues to wealth, propitiate
power, win patronage, insure advancement. Finding where
the preponderance of forces lies, they attach themselves to the
stronger. No matter whether the tide ebbs or flows, they drift
with the current. If popular views change, they change, “like a
wave driven with the wind and tossed;” like a chameleon, changing
its color with every contact.</p>

<p>Some of this class, more sagacious, though not less false to principle,
than the rest, ascend an eminence, whence they can survey
the direction of forces, mark the future point and period of their
union, and then they strike at once for the spot whither those forces
are converging They, not less than their fellows, warp eternal
principles to suit the vice of the hour, only it is an hour somewhat
future, instead of the present one.</p>

<p>3. But there is a third class of Young Men who are true to the
sacred instincts of virtue, and devoutly reverent of duty. They
seek, not for the time-hallowed, but for the truth-hallowed. They
have learnt that, in the divine classification, there are but two
great objects in the universe,—God and Mankind. These are the
only existences recognized in those two supreme laws, which, by
divine prerogative, hold all other laws in their embrace. Hence the
two resulting and all-comprehending duties,—love to God and love
to Man. The convictions and sentiments which belong to the
Brotherhood of the one, stand upon the same basis of authority as
those which belong to the Fatherhood of the other. Hence all
other entities and possibilities,—opulence, power, fame, genius,
things present, or things to come,—are, and forever must be, secondary
and subordinate to these primary and everlasting laws. No
names so lofty, no multitude so large, that they can abolish these
truths, or abstract one jot or tittle from their binding force, in this
life, or in any life. They are coëternal with their Author; unchangeable
as He, and moral life and moral death wait upon their award.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_vi">[Pg vi]</span></p>

<p>When the Young Man of this class looks within himself, he finds
the constitution of his own moral nature to be such, that annihilation
with truth is better than the most favored existence with error.
And when he looks without himself, he sees there is a God enthroned
above, mightier than every “god of this world,” and that
there is a divine law higher than any laws of fallible men. Hence
he knows that Right and Truth will assuredly triumph, and that all
who oppose them will be scattered as the whirlwind scatters the
chaff. The patriarchs sold Joseph into Egypt; yet God was
with him, and raised him to honor, and at last put the lives of his
treacherous brethren into his hands.</p>

<p>Whatever may be the peculiar madness of the hour, in whatever
direction the gauds of wealth may beckon, or the prizes of ambition
call, let the Young Man remember, <i>that</i> only can be honorable
which is just, that only can be safe which is right. Hence,
though the perfumed breezes of flattery may entice him on one side,
and a storm of maledictions beat fiercely against him on the other,
let him consecrate himself to Justice and Truth, and be inspired
with the faith that, though the earth should quake or the heavens
fall, an omniscient eye will over-watch, and an omniscient arm will
protect him.</p>

<p>Among the wiles of the sorceress that beguile the young to their
ruin there is no more seductive, yet fallacious temptation, than the
value which seems to belong to the passing hour, and to the pleasures
it may bring. How infinitely small a part of existence is the
present day, or year! How insignificant its point compared with
the ages to come! What are its huzzas, its ostentation, and its
pride, when placed in the balance against the eternity of rewards
that crown allegiance to duty? O, how insane and fatuous to
barter the undecaying honors of the future for the transitory joys
of the present! In the future, lies the wealth of every man; the
present is only an opportunity to make its title secure. The temporizer
must snatch from hour to hour at some new expedient, which,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_vii">[Pg vii]</span>
if he fails to seize, he sinks to perdition. The virtuous man binds
himself to a principle, and soars securely through all worlds.</p>

<hr class="tb">

<p>Nothing stands upon a more adamantine basis of truth than the
principles which decide between Human Freedom and Human
Slavery. These eternal principles happen now, in a peculiar degree,
to be implicated in the shifting and uncertain current of politics;
and political storms may seem for a time to overwhelm them. But
the cloud which obscures the sun does not annihilate it; and these
principles are sure to emerge and shine unclouded in their native
splendor forever. Every act, whether of individuals or of governments,
whether committed in past days or in our day, which compromises
the sacred principles of Human Freedom, or postpones its interests
to other interests, is set down, in the calendar of fate, for ultimate
and universal execration. This is just as certain as it is that the great
crimes of the race committed in past ages,—the persecutions of the
early Christians, the tortures of the Inquisition, or the atrocities of
the African Slave trade,—are now condemned by the awful verdict
of history and the ever-sounding reprobation of mankind. In the
spread of Christianity, in the advance of civilization, in the moral
development of the people, a tribunal is now preparing, which will
pronounce sentence of condemnation against the abetters of slavery,
to be promulgated as from Sinai, and preserved in the archives of
eternity. The Progress of the Age bears us on, not only to a forward,
but to an upward point; and what we now say against the
apostates to duty and the traitors of mankind, in past ages, however
much they may have been honored, caressed, and rewarded in their
day, will soon be said of every one amongst ourselves who leads or
joins the band of conspirators against the Rights of Man.</p>

<p>Every Young Man, however obscure or powerless he may seem,
can do something for the cause of freedom. Whatever disadvantages
the youth may labor under, they have one all-compensating
advantage. A longer period of life is before them, and deeds
which can only be accomplished through years of labor, they can<span class="pagenum" id="Page_viii">[Pg viii]</span>
achieve. But our success depends infinitely less upon our strength
than upon our motive. When we supply the virtuous will, God
supplies the power; so that the result corresponds, not to our weakness,
but to his omnipotence. We are thus made able</p>

<p>Those Young Men of Massachusetts, then, of the noble lineage
of the Pilgrims, who have been nursed amid the influences of sanctuary
and school, in whose bosoms is the sacred depository of future and
boundless hopes, but who are now counselled to abandon their integrity,
who are brought into peril of being corrupted by the lures
of wealth, or fascinated by the dazzling of worldly honors, or swept
away by the pressure of the multitude that do evil, I adjure to stand
fast and immovable on those sacred and eternal principles of Human
Liberty which came down to us <i>through</i> the fires of oppression
and the agony and blood of martyrs, but came <i>from</i> God;—principles
that can never suffer the decays of time, which kings nor
senates of kings can ever abolish, and which, however much the
passions of men may seek to taint or defile them, are ever beautiful
and fair, as the names of all their disciples shall hereafter be. I call
upon Young Men to throw themselves forward in imagination into
middle life, or old age, and there behold how these mighty questions
will look in the retrospect of time, when the brilliant robes which
now gild the tempter are gone, and only the ghastly fiend remains;
when the passion that prompted the crime is dead, and only the
remorse survives. Think not of luxury, or wealth, or ignoble ease,
but only of an heroic conflict, careless of the present strength of the
foe. Take no bribe from the hand of power, in whatever disguise
of beauty it may come, but spurn it and its author alike. Let your
future manhood realize the generous aspirations of your youth; and,
amid the seductions of the present hour, prize only the jubilant<span class="pagenum" id="Page_ix">[Pg ix]</span>
memories you can lay up for old age. It may grieve you to break
friendships, but truth and duty are your nearest friends. It may be
painful to live amongst those who upbraid and condemn you; but be
a coward when virtue is in peril, and your own accusing conscience
you must live with forever. Study those exemplars of excellence who
came purified and resplendent out of fiery trials. It is said of Francis
the First, that when he read the valorous exploits of Gaston de Foix,
he wept tears of emulation. Rejoice, then, though marshalled in the
fore front of battle when the Rights of Humanity are in danger,
and you shall rejoice again and forever in their triumph. Read and
ponder what was so nobly said by one of the heathen of the old
world, and be ashamed, yea, weep for your country and your kind,
if the Christianity of America has fallen below the paganism of
Rome. Seneca says,—</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>“Virtue covets danger; and whatever may be her aim, she never stops to
consider how much she may suffer, since her sufferings are a part of her
glory. Military men glory in their scars. With exultation they point us to
their blood flowing in an honorable cause. Though they who return <i>unharmed</i>
from the field of battle may have done as many and as noble deeds,
yet it is the <i>wounded</i> soldier who receives double honors. God provides for
those whom he would make most honorable, by furnishing them with opportunities
for achieving valiant and noble deeds. Hence he strews difficulties
along their path. It is in the storm you see who is worthy to be a pilot; and
in battle, who is the soldier.... How can I know with what constancy
and endurance one will bear up against reproach and obloquy and popular
odium, if he has grown old amidst the applauses of the world, if he has
never encountered misfortune, and has been followed by the indiscriminating
favor of men?... Be not affrighted, I beseech you, at the dangers which
were intended by the immortal gods only as stimulants to exertion. The season
of calamity is virtue’s opportunity. <i>They</i>, rather, are to be esteemed wretched,
who lie torpid in luxurious ease, whom a sluggish calm detains on the great
voyage, like vessels that lie weltering on a sea without a gale. Whom God
approves and loves, he exercises, and tries them again and again, and thus inures
them to hardship; but those whom he designs to enervate, he spares and
indulges and saves them from impending ills.... The <i>bravest</i> of the
army are they whom the commander selects for the most perilous service. The<span class="pagenum" id="Page_x">[Pg x]</span>
general details his choicest men to send on secret expeditions by night, or to
explore an unknown way, or to dislodge a garrison from their entrenchments.
No man chosen for such an enterprise is ever heard to say, ‘<i>My commander
has wronged and dishonored me</i>,’ but rather, ‘<i>He has known well whom to
choose.</i>’ Such, too, is the language of those who are required to suffer what
would make the timid and the ignoble weep. We stand honored in the divine
regards when the great experiment, <i>how much human nature can endure for a
virtuous cause</i>, is tried in ourselves.... As teachers deal with their
scholars, so God deals with good men. He demands most of those in whom
he has most confidence.”</p>

<p>Your communication of the 16th inst., being directed
to Newton, (instead of West Newton, where I reside,)
did not reach me until this morning. I thank you
cordially for the kind expressions of personal regard
with which you have been pleased to accompany it.
You inform me that at a convention of delegates
assembled in Dedham, on Wednesday, the 15th inst.,
I was nominated as a candidate to fill the vacancy in
Congress occasioned by the death of the great and
good man whose irreparable loss we, his constituents,
with a nation for our fellow-mourners, deplore.</p>

<p>At first thought, the idea of being the immediate
successor of John Quincy Adams in the councils of
the nation might well cause any man to shrink back
from the inevitable contrast. But it is obvious, on a
moment’s reflection, that the difference is so trivial
between all the men whom he has left, compared with
the disparity between them and him, as to render it of
little consequence, in this respect, who shall succeed
him; and the people in the Eighth District, in their descent
from Mr. Adams to any successor, must break and
bear the shock of the fall, as best they can.</p>

<p>I most heartily concur with you in that estimate of
the services, and veneration for the character, of our
late representative, which your resolutions so eloquently
express. To be fired by his example, to imitate<span class="pagenum" id="Page_2">[Pg 2]</span>
his diligence and fidelity in the discharge of every
trust, to emulate his moral intrepidity, which always
preferred to stand alone by the right, rather than to
join the retinue and receive the plaudits of millions, as
a champion of the wrong,—this would be, in the beautiful
language of the Roman historian, “to ascend to
glory by the path of virtue.”</p>

<p>One of the resolutions adopted by your convention
declares the three following things:—</p>

<p>1. That the successor of Mr. Adams, on the floor
of Congress, should be a man “whose principles shall
be in consonance with those of his predecessor.”</p>

<p>2. That his fidelity to the great principles of human
freedom shall be unwavering. And,—</p>

<p>3. That his “voice and vote shall on all occasions
be exercised in extending and securing liberty to the
human race.”</p>

<p>Permit me to reäffirm these sentiments with my
whole heart. Should the responsibilities of that successorship
ever be devolved upon me, I shall endeavor
so to fulfil them, that these dead words should become
a living soul. I should deem it not only an object of
duty, but of the highest ambition, to contend for the
noble principles you have here expressed, as Mr. Adams
contended for them; though, unhappily, it would be
only as a David in Saul’s armor. Bear with me for a
moment while I enlarge upon these sentiments.</p>

<p>1. “<i>In consonance with his principles.</i>”—I believe
it was the sovereign rule of Mr. Adams’s life to act in
obedience to his convictions of duty. Truth was his
guide. His conscience was non-elastic. He did not
strain at a gnat before company, on account of its size,
and then, privately, swallow a camel. His patriotism
was coëxtensive with his country; it could not be
crushed and squeezed in between party lines. Though
liable to err,—and what human being is not?—yet
his principles were believed by him to be in accordance<span class="pagenum" id="Page_3">[Pg 3]</span>
with the great moral laws of the universe. They
were thought out from duty and religion, and not
carved out of expediency. When invested with patronage,
he never dismissed a man from office because
he was a political opponent, and never appointed one
to office merely because he was a political friend.
Hence he drew from Mr. Holmes, of South Carolina,
this noble eulogium,—a eulogium, considering the
part of the country from which it came, as honorable
to its author as to its object,—that “he crushed no
heart beneath the rude grasp of proscription; he left
no heritage of widows’ cries or orphans’ tears.” Could
all the honors which Mr. Adams ever won from offices
held under the first five Presidents of the United
States, and from a public service, which, commencing
more than fifty years ago, continued to the day of his
death, be concentrated in one effulgent blaze, they
would be less far-shining and inextinguishable than the
honor of sacrificing his election for a second presidential
term, because he would not, in order to obtain it, prostitute
the patronage and power which the constitution
had placed in his hands. I regard this as the sublimest
spectacle in his long and varied career. He stood
within reach of an object of ambition doubtless dearer
to him than life. He could have laid his hands upon
it. The “still, small voice” said, No! Without a
murmur, he saw it taken and borne away in triumph
by another. Compared with this, the block of many
a martyr has been an easy resting-place.</p>

<p>2. “<i>Unwavering fidelity to the great principles of
human freedom.</i>”—The Declaration of American
Independence, in 1776, was the first complete assertion
of human rights, on an extensive scale, ever made by
mankind. Less than three quarters of a century have
elapsed, and already the greatest portion of the civilized
world has felt the influence of that Declaration.
France, for years, has had a constitutional monarchy;<span class="pagenum" id="Page_4">[Pg 4]</span>
perhaps, to-day, her government is republican. Holland
and Belgium are comparatively free. Almost all the
states of the Germanic Confederation have a written
constitution, and a legislature with a popular branch.
Prussia has lately commenced a representative system.
The iron rule of Austria is relaxed under the fervent
heat which liberty reflects from surrounding nations.
Naples and Sicily have just burst the bonds of
tyranny. In Rome and the States of the Church,
where, under the influence of religious and political
despotism, the heart of Freedom was supposed to be
petrified into insoluble hardness, that heart is now beginning
to pulsate with a new life, and to throb with
sympathy for humanity. Great Britain and Denmark
have emancipated their slaves in the West Indies.
Measures are now in progress to ameliorate the condition
of Russian serfs. Even half-barbarous, Mahometan
Tunis has yielded to the tide of free principles.
To what bar of judgment will our own posterity bring
us, what doom of infamy will history pronounce upon
us, if the United States shall hereafter be found the
only portion of Christendom where the principles of
our own Declaration of Independence are violated in
the persons of millions of our people?</p>

<p>3. “<i>The exercise, on all occasions, of voice and vote,
in extending and securing liberty to the human race.</i>”—There
is a crisis in our affairs. A territory, in extent
far exceeding that of the thirteen original states, when
they repelled the power of Great Britain, has lately
been added, or is, doubtless, about to be added, to our
national domain. The expanse of this territory is so
vast, that it may be divided into a dozen sections, and
these sections may be erected into separate states, each
one of which shall be so large that Massachusetts
would seem but an inconsiderable court-yard, if placed
in front of it. Parts of this territory are fertile and
salubrious. It is capable of supporting millions and<span class="pagenum" id="Page_5">[Pg 5]</span>
millions of human beings, of the same generation.
The numbers of the successive generations, which in
the providence of God are to inhabit it, will be as the
leaves of the forest, or the sands on the sea-shore.
Each one of these is to be a living soul, with its
joys and sorrows, its hopes and fears, its susceptibilities
of exaltation or of abasement. Each one will be capable
of being formed into the image of God, or of
being deformed into the image of all that is anti-godlike.</p>

<p>These countless millions are to be our kindred;
many of them, perhaps, our own descendants; at any
rate, our brethren of the human family; for has not
God “made of one blood all nations of men to dwell
upon all the face of the earth”? In rights, in character,
in happiness; in freedom or in vassalage; in the
glorious immunities and prerogatives of knowledge, or
in the debasement and superstitions of ignorance; in
their upward-looking aspiration and love of moral excellence,
or in their downward-looking, prone-rushing,
and brutish appetites and passions, what shall these millions
of our fellow-creatures be? I put it as a practical
question, What shall these millions of our fellow-creatures
be?—for it is more than probable that this very
generation,—nay, that the actors in public affairs, before
the sands of the present year shall have run out,—will
prescribe and foreördain their doom. That doom
will be what our present conduct predestines.</p>

<p>If we enact laws and establish institutions, under
whose benign influences that vast tract of territory
shall at length teem with myriads of human beings,
each one a free-born man; each one enjoying the inalienable
right of “life, liberty, and the pursuit of happiness;”
each one free for the cultivation of his capacities,
and free in the choice and in the rewards of his
labor;—if we do this, although the grand results may
not manifest themselves for a thousand years, yet when<span class="pagenum" id="Page_6">[Pg 6]</span>
the fulness of time shall come, the equity and the
honor of framing these laws and institutions will
belong to us, as much as though the glorious consummation
could be realized to-morrow. On the other
hand, if we so shape the mould in which their fortunes
are to be cast, that, for them or for any portion of them,
there shall be servitude instead of liberty, ignorance
instead of education, debasement instead of dignity,
the indulgence of bestial appetites instead of the sanctities
and securities of domestic life,—then, until the
mountains shall crumble away by age, until the arches
of the skies shall fall in rottenness, these mountains
and these arches will never cease to echo back the execrations
upon our memory of all the great and good
men of the world. And this retribution, I believe, will
come suddenly, as well as last forever.</p>

<p>In one of the South-western States a vast subterranean
cave has been discovered, deep down in whose
chambers there is a pool of water, on which no beam
of sunlight ever shines. A sightless fish is said to inhabit
this rayless pool. In this animal, indeed, the
rudiments of a visual organ are supposed to be dimly
discernible; but of an orb to refract the rays of light,
or of a retina to receive them, there is no trace. Naturalists
suppose that the progenitors of these animals,
in ages long gone by, possessed the power of vision;
but that, being buried in these depths by some convulsion
of nature, long disuse at first impaired, at length
extinguished, and has at last obliterated the visual
organ itself. The animal has sunk in the scale of
being, until its senses are accommodated to the blackness
of darkness in which it dwells. Were this
account wholly fabulous, it has the strongest verisimilitude,
and doubtless describes what would actually
occur under the circumstances supposed.</p>

<p>Thus will it be with faculties above the surface of
the earth, as well as below it. Thus will it be with<span class="pagenum" id="Page_7">[Pg 7]</span>
human beings, as well as with the lower orders of
creation. Thus will it be with our own brethren or
children, should we shut up from them the book of
knowledge, or seal their senses so that they could not
read it. Thus will it be with all our God-given faculties,
just so far as they are debarred from legitimate
exercise upon their appropriate objects. The love of
knowledge will die out, when it ceases to be stimulated
by the means of knowledge. Self-respect will die out,
under the ever-present sense of inferiority. The sentiments
of truth and duty will die out, when cunning
and falsehood can obtain more gratifications than
frankness and honesty. The noblest impulses of the
human soul, the most sacred affections of the human
heart, will die out, when every sphere is closed against
their exercise. When such a dreadful work is doing,
or threatens to be done, can any one stand listlessly by,
see it perpetrated, and then expect to excuse himself,
under the false, impious pretext of Cain, “Am I my
brother’s keeper?”</p>

<p>Fully, then, do I agree with you and the delegates
of the convention you represent, in saying that the
successor of Mr. Adams should be one “whose voice
and vote shall, on all occasions, be exercised in extending
and securing liberty to the human race.” Of course
I do not understand you to imply any violation of the
constitution of the United States, which every representative
swears to support.</p>

<p>Permit me to say a word personal to myself. For
eleven years, I have been estranged from all political
excitements. During this whole period, I have attended
no political meeting of any kind whatever. I have
contented myself with the right of private judgment
and the right of voting, though it has usually so happened
that my official duties have demanded my
absence from home at the time of the fall elections. I
have deemed this abstinence from <i>actively</i> mingling in
political contests both a matter of duty towards opposing<span class="pagenum" id="Page_8">[Pg 8]</span>
political parties, and a proper means of subserving
the best interests of the cause in which I had embarked.
I hoped too, by so doing, to assist in rearing
men even better than those now belonging to any party.</p>

<p>The nature of my duties also, and all my intercourse
and associations, have attracted me towards whatever
is worthy and beneficent in all parties, rather than
towards what is peculiar to any one. Not believing
in political pledges, I should have had the honor to
decline giving any to you, had you not had the first
and greater honor of asking none from me. After
what I have said above in favor of liberty for all mankind,
it would be a strange contradiction did I consent
to be myself a slave of party. The hands which you
raised in behalf of yourselves and your constituents,
when you voted for the noble sentiments contained in
the resolution I have quoted, could never degrade
themselves by forging a fetter for the free mind of
another, or fastening one upon it; and the hand with
which I have penned my hearty response to those
sentiments can never stretch itself out to take a fetter
on. Should your nomination, therefore, be accepted
and be successful, it must be with the explicit understanding
between us that I shall always be open to
receive the advice of my constituents, shall always
welcome their counsel, always be most grateful for
their suggestions, but that, in the last resort, my own
sense of duty must be the only arbiter. Should differences
arise, the law opens an honorable escape for both
parties,—declination on my part, substitution on yours.</p>

<p>I must add, in closing, that so far as personal preferences
are concerned, I infinitely prefer remaining in
my present position, with all its labor and its thanklessness,
to any office in the gift of the people. I had
hoped and intended, either in a public or private
capacity, to spend my life in advancing the great cause
of the people’s education. Two considerations alone
could tempt me to abandon this purpose. The first is<span class="pagenum" id="Page_9">[Pg 9]</span>
important. The enactment of laws which shall cover
waste territory, to be applied to the myriads of human
beings who are hereafter to occupy that territory, is a
work which seems to precede and outrank even education
itself. Whether a wide expanse of country
shall be filled with beings to whom education is permitted,
or with those to whom it is denied,—with
those whom humanity and the law make it a duty to
teach, or with those whom inhumanity and the law
make it a <i>legal</i> duty not to teach, seems preliminary
to all questions respecting the best systems and methods
for rendering education effective.</p>

<p>The other consideration is comparatively unimportant;
though, for the time being, it has embarrassed
me greatly. I now learn that expectations were excited
at your convention, that if a nomination were
tendered me, it would not be declined. Had I anticipated
the favorable regards of the convention, or foreseen
that such expectations would be raised, I should
not have hearkened to the proposition for a moment;
and I may be permitted to add, that when I saw my
name announced in the papers, my first act was to prepare
a letter of declination. It was only when I went
to deliver the letter that I learnt what had been
done, and that, in the opinion of persons whose
judgment I am bound to respect, I had been so far
committed by my too partial friends, as that no option
remained.</p>

<p>Yielding to these considerations, I submit myself to
the decision of my fellow-citizens.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Mr. Chairman</span>;</p>

<p>I have listened with interest, both yesterday and to-day,
to speeches on what is called the “Presidential
Question.” I propose to discuss a question of far
greater magnitude,—the question of the age,—one
whose consequences will not end with the ensuing four
years, but will reach forward to the setting of the sun
of time.</p>

<p>Sir, our position is this: The United States finds
itself the owner of a vast region of country at the
west, now almost vacant of inhabitants. Parts of this
region are salubrious and fertile. We have reason to
suppose, that, in addition to the treasures of wealth
which industry may gather from its surface, there are
mineral treasures beneath it,—riches garnered up of
old in subterranean chambers, and only awaiting the
application of intelligence and skill to be converted
into the means of human improvement and happiness.
These regions, it is true, lie remote from our place of
residence. Their shores are washed by another sea,
and it is no figure of speech to say that another sky
bends over them. So remote are they, that their hours
are not as our hours, nor their day as our day; and
yet, such are the wonderful improvements in art, in
modern times, as to make it no rash anticipation, that,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_11">[Pg 11]</span>
before this century shall have closed, the inhabitants
on the Atlantic shores will be able to visit their brethren
on the Pacific in ten days; and that intelligence
will be transmitted and returned between the eastern
and the western oceans in ten minutes. That country,
therefore, will be rapidly filled, and we shall be brought
into intimate relations with it, and, notwithstanding
its distance, into proximity to it.</p>

<p>Now, in the providence of God, it has fallen to our
lot to legislate for this unoccupied, or but partially occupied,
expanse. Its great future hangs upon our
decision. Not only degrees of latitude and longitude,
but vast tracts of time,—ages and centuries,—seem at
our disposal. As are the institutions which we form
and establish there, so will be the men whom these
institutions, in their turn, will form. Nature works by
fixed laws; but we can bring this or that combination
of circumstances under the operation of her laws, and
thus determine results. Here springs up our responsibility.
One class of institutions will gather there one
class of men, who will develop one set of characteristics;
another class of institutions will gather there
another class of men, who will develop other characteristics.
Hence their futurity is to depend upon our
present action. Hence the acts we are to perform
seem to partake of the nature of creation, rather than
of legislation. Standing upon the elevation which we
now occupy, and looking over into that empty world,
“yet void,” if not “without form,” but soon to be
filled with multitudinous life, and reflecting upon our
power to give form and character to that life, and
almost to foreördain what it shall be, I feel as though
it would be no irreverence to compare our condition to
that of the Creator before he fashioned the “lord” of
this lower world; for we, like Him, can ingraft one
set of attributes, or another set of attributes, upon a
whole race of men. In approaching this subject, therefore,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_12">[Pg 12]</span>
I feel a sense of responsibility corresponding to
the infinite,—I speak literally,—the <i>infinite</i> interests
which it embraces.</p>

<p>As far as the time allowed me will permit, I propose
to discuss two questions. The first is, “<i>Whether
Congress can lawfully legislate on the subject of slavery
in the territories</i>.”</p>

<p>On this question a new and most extraordinary doctrine
has lately been broached. A new reading of the
constitution has been discovered. It is averred that
the 3d section of the 4th article, giving Congress power
“to dispose of, and make all needful rules and regulations
respecting the territory or other property belonging
to the United States,” only gives power to legislate
for the land <i>as land</i>. It is admitted that Congress may
legislate for the land <i>as land</i>,—geologically or botanically
considered,—perhaps for the beasts that roam
upon its surface, or the fishes that swim in its waters;
but it is denied that Congress possesses any power to
determine the laws and the institutions of those who
shall inhabit that “land.”</p>

<p>But compare this with any other object of purchase
or possession. When Texas was admitted into the
Union, it transferred its “navy” to the United States;
in other words, the United States bought, and of course
owned, the navy of Texas. What power had Congress
over this navy, after the purchase? According
to the new doctrine, it could pass laws for the hull,
the masts, and the sails of the Texan ships, but would
have no power to navigate them by officers and men.
It might govern the ships as so much wood, iron, and
cordage, but would have no authority over commanders
or crews.</p>

<p>But we are challenged to show any clause in the
constitution which confers an <i>express</i> power to legislate
over the territories we possess. I challenge our
opponents to show any clause which confers express<span class="pagenum" id="Page_13">[Pg 13]</span>
power to acquire those territories themselves. If, then,
the power to acquire exists, it exists by implication and
inference; and if the power <i>to acquire</i> be an implied
one, the power <i>to govern what is acquired</i> must be implied
also. For, for what purpose does any man
acquire property but to govern and control it? What
does a buyer pay for, if it be not the right to “dispose
of”? Such is the doctrine of the Supreme Court of
the United States: “The right to govern,” says Chief
Justice Marshall, “may be the inevitable consequence
of the right to acquire.” <i>Amer. Ins. Co.</i> vs. <i>Canter</i>,
<i>1 Peters</i>, 542. See also <i>McCullough</i> vs. <i>Maryland</i>, <i>4
Wheat.</i>, 422. <i>The Cherokee Nation</i> vs. <i>Georgia</i>, <i>5
Peters</i>, 44. <i>United States</i> vs. <i>Gratiot</i>, <i>14 Peters</i>,
537.</p>

<p>But I refer to the express words of the constitution,
as ample and effective in conferring all the power that
is claimed. “Congress may dispose of, and make all
needful rules and regulations,” &amp;c. If Congress may
“dispose of” this land, then it may sell it. Inseparable
from the right to sell is the right to define the
terms of sale. The seller may affix such conditions
and limitations as he pleases to the thing sold. If this
be not so, then the buyer may dictate his terms to the
seller. Answer these simple questions: Supposing
the United States to own land in fee simple, then, is
the government under guardianship, or disabled by
minority? Is it <i>non compos mentis</i>? If no such disability
applies to it, then it may sell. It may sell the fee
simple, or it may carve out a lesser estate, and sell
that. It may incorporate such terms and conditions
as it pleases into its deed or patent of sale. It may
make an outright quitclaim, or it may reserve the
minerals for its own use, or the navigable streams for
public highways, as it did in regard to the territory
north-west of the river Ohio. It may insert the conditions
and limitations in each deed or patent; or,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_14">[Pg 14]</span>
where the grantees are numerous, it may make general
“rules and regulations,” which are understood to be a
part of each contract, and are therefore binding upon
each purchaser. No man is compelled to buy; but if any
one does buy, he buys subject to the “rules and regulations”
expressed in the grant; and neither he, nor
his grantees, nor his or their heirs after them, can complain.
I want, therefore, no better foundation for
legislating over the territories than the fact of ownership
in the United States. Grant this, and all is granted.
If I own a farm, or a shop, I may, as owner, prescribe
the conditions of its transfer to another. If he
does not like my conditions, then let him abandon the
negotiation; if he accedes to the conditions, then let
him abide by them, and hold his peace.</p>

<p>Sir, in the state to which I belong, we hold temperance
to be a great blessing, as well as a great virtue;
and intemperance to be a great curse, as well as a
great sin. I know of incorporated companies there,
who have purchased large tracts of land for manufacturing
purposes. They well know how essential is the
sobriety of workmen to the profitableness of their
work; they know, too, how wasteful and destructive
is inebriety. In disposing of their land, therefore, to
the men whom they would gather about them and
employ, they incorporate the provision, as a fundamental
article in the deed of grant, that ardent spirits
shall never be sold upon the premises; and thus they
shut up, at once, one of the most densely-thronged
gateways of hell. Have they not a right to do so,
from the mere fact of ownership? Would any judge
or lawyer doubt the validity of such a condition; or
would any sensible man ever doubt its wisdom or
humanity? Pecuniarily and morally, this comes under
the head of “needful rules and regulations.” If tipplers
do not like them, let them stagger away, and
seek their residence elsewhere.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_15">[Pg 15]</span></p>

<p>But the United States is not merely a land owner;
it is a sovereignty. As such, it exercises all constitutional
jurisdiction over all its territories. Whence, but
from this right of sovereignty, does the government
obtain its power of saying that no man shall purchase
land of the natives, or aborigines; and that, if you
wish to buy land in the territories, you shall come to
the government for it? Is there any express power in
the constitution authorizing Congress to say to all the
citizens of the United States, “If you wish to buy
ungranted land in the territories, you must come to us,
for no one else can sell, or shall sell”? This right,
sustained by all our legislation and adjudications, covers
the whole ground. <i>Lessee of Johnson et al.</i> vs.
<i>McIntosh</i>, <i>8 Wheaton</i>, 543; <i>5 Cond. Rep.</i> 515.</p>

<p>But, leaving the constitution, it is denied that there
are precedents. The honorable gentlemen from Virginia
[Mr. Bayly] has not only contested the power
of Congress to legislate on the subject of slavery in
the territories, but he has denied the existence of precedents
to sustain this power. Sir, it would have been
an assertion far less bold, to deny the existence of
precedents for the election of a President of the United
States; for the instances of the latter have been far
less frequent than of the former. Congress has legislated
on the subject of slavery in the territories all the
way up from the adoption of the constitution to the
present time; and this legislation has been sustained
by the judiciary of both the general and state governments,
and carried into execution by the executive
power of both. See <i>Menard</i> vs. <i>Aspasia</i>, <i>5 Peters</i>,
505; <i>Phebe et al.</i> vs. <i>Jay</i>, <i>Breese’s Rep.</i> 210; <i>Hogg</i>
vs. <i>The Zanesville Canal Co.</i>, <i>5 Ohio Rep.</i> 410; <i>Martin’s
Louisiana Rep. N. S.</i> 699; <i>Spooner</i> vs. <i>McConnell</i>,
<i>1 McLean’s Rep.</i> 341; <i>Harvey</i> vs. <i>Deeker</i>,
<i>Walker’s Mississippi Rep.</i> 36; <i>Rachael</i> vs. <i>Walker</i>, <i>4
Missouri Rep.</i> 350.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_16">[Pg 16]</span></p>

<p>So far as the uniform practice of sixty years can
settle a doubtful, or confirm an admitted right, this
power of legislating over the territories has been taken
from the region of doubt, and established upon the
basis of acknowledged authority. In legislating for
all that is now Ohio, Indiana, Illinois, Wisconsin,
Michigan, Iowa, Missouri, Arkansas, Mississippi, Louisiana,
and Florida, we have legislated on the subject
of slavery in the territories. Sixty years of legislation
on one side, and not a denial of the right on the other.</p>

<p>But the gentleman from Virginia [Mr. Bayly] says,
that the action of Congress in regard to the territories
has been rather that of constitution-making than of
law-making. Suppose this to be true; does not the
greater include the less? If Congress could make a
constitution for all the territories,—an organic, fundamental
law,—a law of laws,—could it not, had it so
pleased, make the law itself? A constitution prescribes
to the legislature what it shall do, and what it shall
not do; it commands, prohibits, and binds men by
oaths to support itself. It says, “Hitherto <span class="allsmcap">SHALT</span> thou
come, and no farther.” And if Congress can do this,
can it not make the local law itself? Can aught be
more preposterous? As if we could <i>command</i> others
to do what we have no right to do ourselves, and prohibit
others from doing what lies beyond our own
jurisdiction! Surely, to decree on what subjects a
community shall legislate, and on what they shall
not legislate, is the exercise of the highest power.</p>

<p>But Congress has not stopped with the exercise of
the constitution-making power. In various forms, and
at all times, it has legislated for the territories, in the
strictest sense of the word <i>legislation</i>. It has legislated
again and again, and ten times again, on this very
subject of slavery. See the act of 1794, prohibiting
the slave trade from “any port <i>or place</i>” in the United
States. Could any citizen of the United States, under<span class="pagenum" id="Page_17">[Pg 17]</span>
this act, have gone into one of our territories and there
have fitted out vessels for the slave trade? Surely he
could, if Congress had no right to legislate over territories
only as so much land and water.</p>

<p>By statute 1798, chapter 28, § 7, slaves were forbidden
to be brought into the Mississippi Territory from
without the United States, and all slaves so brought in
<i>were made free</i>.</p>

<p>So the act of 1800, chapter 51, in further prohibition
of the slave trade, applied to all citizens of the
United States, whether living in territories or in organized
states. Did not this legislation cover the
territories?</p>

<p>By statute 1804, chapter 38, § 10, three classes of
slaves were forbidden to be introduced into the Orleans
Territory.</p>

<p>Statute 1807, chapter 22, prohibiting the importation
of slaves after January 1, 1808, prohibited their importation
into the territories in express terms.</p>

<p>Statute 1818, chapter 91, statute 1819, chapter 101,
and statute 1820, chapter 113, prohibiting the slave
trade, and making it piracy, expressly included all the
territories of the United States.</p>

<p>Statute 1819, chapter 21, authorized the President
to provide for the safe-keeping of slaves imported from
Africa, and for their removal to their home in that land.
Under this law, the President might have established
a depot for slaves within the limits of our territories,
on the gulf, or on the Mississippi.</p>

<p>By statute 1820, chapter 22, § 8, Congress established
what has been called the Missouri compromise
line, thereby expressly legislating on the subject of
slavery. So of Texas. See <i>Jo. Res. March 1, 1851</i>.</p>

<p>By statute 1819, chapter 93, statute 1821, chapter
39, § 2, and statute 1822, chapter 13, § 9, Congress
legislated on the subject of slavery in the Territory of
Florida.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_18">[Pg 18]</span></p>

<p>Does it not seem almost incredible that a defender
and champion of slavery should deny the power of
Congress to legislate on the subject of slavery in the
territories? If Congress has no such power, by what
right can a master recapture a fugitive slave escaping
into a territory? The constitution says, “No person
held to service, or labor, in one <i>state</i>, escaping into
another,”—that is, another <i>state</i>,—“shall be discharged
from such service, or labor,” &amp;c. The act of
1793, chapter 7, § 3, provides that when a person held
to labor, &amp;c., “shall escape into any other of the said
states, <i>or territory</i>,” he may be taken. By what other
law than this can a runaway slave be retaken <i>in a
territory</i>? If Congress has no power to legislate on
the subject of slavery in any territory, then, surely, it
cannot legislate for the capture of a fugitive slave in a
territory. The argument cuts both ways. The knife
wounds him who would use it to wound his fellow.</p>

<p>Further than this. If slavery is claimed to be one
of the common subjects of legislation, then any legislation
by Congress for the territories, on any of the
common subjects of legislation, is a precedent, going
to prove its right to legislate on slavery itself. If
Congress may legislate on one subject belonging to a
class, then it may legislate on any other subject belonging
to the same class. Now, Congress has legislated
for the territories on almost the whole circle of
subjects belonging to common legislation. It has legislated
on the elective franchise, on the pecuniary qualifications
and residence of candidates for office, on the
militia, on oaths, on the <i>per diem</i> and mileage of
members, &amp;c., &amp;c. By statute 1811, chapter 21, § 3,
authorizing the Territory of Orleans to form a constitution,
it was provided that all legislative proceedings
and judicial records should be kept and promulgated in
the English language. Cannot Congress make provision
for the rights of the people, as well as for the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_19">[Pg 19]</span>
language in which the laws and records defining those
rights shall be expressed? Any language is sweet to
the ears of man which gives him the right of trial by
jury, of habeas corpus, of religious freedom, and of
life, limb, and liberty; but accursed is that language,
and fit only for the realms below, which deprives an
immortal being of the rights of intelligence and of
freedom; of the right to himself, and the dearer rights
of family.</p>

<p>But all this is by no means the strongest part of the
evidence with which our statutes and judicial decisions
abound, showing the power of Congress to legislate
over territories. From the beginning, Congress has
not only legislated over the territories, but it has appointed
and controlled the agents of legislation.</p>

<p>The general structure of the legislature in several
of the earlier territorial governments was this: It
consisted of a governor and of two houses,—an upper
and a lower. Without an exception, where a governor
has been appointed, Congress has always reserved
his appointment to itself, or to the President. The
governor so appointed has always had a veto power
over the two houses; and Congress has always reserved
to itself, or to the President, a veto power, not
only over him, but over him and both the houses besides.
Congress has often interfered also with the
appointment of the upper house, leaving only the
lower house to be chosen exclusively by the people of
the territory; and it has determined even for the lower
house the qualifications both of electors and of elected.
Further still: the power of removing the governor, at
pleasure, has always been reserved to Congress, or to
the President.</p>

<p>Look at this: Congress determines for the territory
the qualifications of electors and elected,—at least in
the first instance. No law of the territorial legislature
is valid until approved by the governor. Though<span class="pagenum" id="Page_20">[Pg 20]</span>
approved by the governor, it may be annulled by Congress,
or by the President; and the governor is appointed,
and may be removed at pleasure, by Congress
or by the President.</p>

<p>To be more specific, I give the following outline of
some of the territorial governments:—</p>

<p><i>Ohio Territory, statute 1789, chapter 8.</i>—A governor
for four years, nominated by the President, approved
by the Senate, with power to appoint all subordinate
civil and military officers.</p>

<p>A secretary for four years, appointed in the same
way.</p>

<p>Three judges, to hold office during good behavior.
Governor and judges the sole legislature, until the district
shall contain five thousand free male inhabitants.
Then,—</p>

<p>A House of Assembly, chosen by qualified electors,
for two years.</p>

<p>A legislative council of five, to hold office for five
years. The House of Assembly to choose ten men,
five of whom are to be selected by the President and
approved by the Senate. These five to be the “Legislative
Council.”</p>

<p>A governor, as before, with an unconditional veto,
and a right to convene, prorogue, and dissolve the
Assembly.</p>

<p>Power given to the President to revoke the commissions
of governor and secretary.</p>

<p><i>Indiana Territory, statute 1800, chapter 41.</i>—Similar
to that of Ohio. At first, the lower house to consist
of not more than nine, nor less than seven.</p>

<p><i>Mississippi Territory, statute 1800, chapter 50.</i>—Similar
to that of Indiana.</p>

<p><i>Michigan Territory, statute 1805, chapter 5.</i>—Similar
to that of Indiana.</p>

<p><i>Illinois Territory, statute 1809, chapter 13.</i>—Similar
to that of Indiana.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_21">[Pg 21]</span></p>

<p><i>Alabama Territory, statute 1817, chapter 59.</i>—Similar
to that of Indiana.</p>

<p><i>Wisconsin Territory, statute 1836, chapter 54.</i>—Governor
for three years, appointed as above, and removable
by the President, with power to appoint officers
and grant pardons. Unconditional veto.</p>

<p>Secretary for four years, removable by the President.
In the absence, or during the inability, of the governor,
to perform his duties.</p>

<p>Legislative Assembly to consist of a Council and a
House of Representatives, to be chosen for two years.
Congress to have an unconditional veto, to be exercised
on laws approved by the governor.</p>

<p><i>Louisiana Territory, statute 1803, chapter 1.</i>—Sole
dictatorial power given to the President of the
United States; and the army and navy of the United
States placed at his command to govern the territorial
inhabitants.—(This was under Mr. Jefferson, a strict
constructionist.)</p>

<p><i>Territory of Orleans, statute 1804, chapter 38.</i>—Governor
nominated by the President, approved by the
Senate, tenure of office three years. Removable by
the President. Secretary for four years, to be governor
in case, &amp;c.</p>

<p>Legislative Council of thirteen, to be annually appointed
by the President.</p>

<p>Governor and Council, of course, a reciprocal negative
on each other. Congress an unconditional veto on
both.</p>

<p><i>District of Louisiana, statute 1804, chapter 38.</i>—To
be governed by the governor and judges of the
Territory of Indiana.</p>

<p>Congress an unconditional veto on all their laws.</p>

<p><i>Missouri Territory, statute 1812, chapter 95.</i>—A
governor, appointable and removable as above.</p>

<p>Secretary, the same.</p>

<p>A Legislative Council of nine. Eighteen persons<span class="pagenum" id="Page_22">[Pg 22]</span>
to be nominated by the House of Representatives
for the territory; nine of these to be selected and
appointed by the President and Senate. A House of
Representatives, to be chosen by the people.</p>

<p><i>Arkansas Territory, statute 1819, chapter 49.</i>—A
governor and secretary, appointable and removable as
above.</p>

<p>All legislative power vested in the governor and in
the judges of the superior court.</p>

<p>When a majority of the <i>freeholders</i> should elect,
then they might adopt the form of government of
Missouri.</p>

<p><i>East and West Florida, statute 1819, chapter 93.—Statute
1821, chapter 29.—Statute 1822, chapter 13.</i>
From March 3, 1819, to March 30, 1822, the government
vested solely in the President of the United
States, and to be exercised by such officers as he
should appoint.</p>

<p>After March 30, 1822, a governor and secretary, appointable
and removable as above.</p>

<p>All legislative power vested in the governor, and in
thirteen persons, called a legislative council, to be appointed
annually by the President.</p>

<p>Yet, sir, notwithstanding all this legislation of Congress
for the territories, on the subject of slavery itself;
notwithstanding its legislation on a great class of subjects
of which slavery is acknowledged to be one;
notwithstanding its appointment, in some cases, of the
legislative power of the territory,—making its own
agent, the governor, removable at pleasure,—giving
him a veto, in the first place, and reserving to itself a
veto when he has approved; notwithstanding the exercise,
in other cases, of full, absolute sovereignty over
the inhabitants of the territories, and all their interests;
and, notwithstanding such has been the practice of the
government for sixty years, under Jefferson, Madison,
Monroe, Jackson, and others, it is now denied that<span class="pagenum" id="Page_23">[Pg 23]</span>
Congress has any right to legislate on the subject of
slavery in the territories. Sir, with a class of politicians
in this country, it has come to this, that slavery is the
only sacred thing in existence. It is self-existent, like
a god, and human power cannot prevent it. From
year to year, it goes on conquering and to conquer, and
human power cannot dethrone it.</p>

<p>Sir, I will present another argument on this subject,
and I do not see how any jurist or statesman can invalidate
it.</p>

<p>Government is one, but its functions are several.
They are legislative, judicial, executive. These functions
are coördinate; each supposes the other two.
There must be a legislature to enact laws; there must
be a judiciary to expound the laws enacted, and point
out the individuals against whom they are to be enforced;
there must be an executive arm to enforce the
decisions of the courts. In every theory of government,
where one of these exist, the others exist.
Under our constitution they are divided into three
parts, and apportioned among three coördinate bodies.
Whoever denies one of these must deny them all.</p>

<p>If the government of the United States, therefore,
has no right to <i>legislate</i> for the territories, it has no
right to <i>adjudicate</i> for the territories; if it has no right
to <i>adjudicate</i>, then it has no right to <i>enforce</i> the decisions
of the judicial tribunals. These rights must
stand or fall together. He who takes from this government
the law-making power, in regard to territories,
strikes also the balances of justice from the hands of
the judge, and the mace of authority from those of
the executive. There is no escape from this conclusion.
The constitution gives no more authority to
adjudge suits in the territories, or to execute the decisions
of the territorial courts, than it does to legislate.
If Congress has no power over territory, only <i>as land</i>,
then what does this land want of judges and marshals?<span class="pagenum" id="Page_24">[Pg 24]</span>
Is it not obvious, then, that this new reading of the
constitution sets aside the whole legislative, judicial,
and executive administration of this government over
territories, since the adoption of the constitution? It
makes the whole of it invalid. The Presidents, all
members of Congress, all judges upon the bench, have
been in a dream for the last sixty years, and are now
waked up and recalled to their senses by the charm of
a newly-discovered reading of the constitution.</p>

<p>Hitherto, sir, I have not directed my remarks to the
actual legislation by Congress on the subject of slavery
in the North-western Territory, so called. That territory
was consecrated to freedom by the ordinance of
1787. It has been said that the <i>Confederation</i> had no
power to pass such an ordinance. But whether this
be so or not, is immaterial, for <i>Congress</i> has ratified
the ordinance again and again. The first Congress at
its first session passed an act whose preamble is as follows:
“Whereas, in order that the ordinance of the
United States, in Congress assembled, for the government
of the territory north-west of the river Ohio, may
continue to have full effect,” &amp;c. It then proceeds to
modify some parts of the ordinance, and to adopt all
the rest.<a id="FNanchor_1" href="#Footnote_1" class="fnanchor">[1]</a></p>

<p>In the second section of the act of 1800, chapter 41,
establishing the Indiana Territory, it is expressly provided
that its government shall be “in all respects similar
to that provided by the ordinance of 1787.”</p>

<p>In the act of 1802, chapter 40, section 5, authorizing
Ohio to form a constitution and state government,
this ordinance of 1787 is three times referred to as a
valid and existing engagement, and it has always been
held to be so by the courts of Ohio.</p>

<p>So in the act of 1816, chapter 57, section 4, authorizing<span class="pagenum" id="Page_25">[Pg 25]</span>
the erection of Indiana into a state, the ordinance
is again recognized, and is made a part of the fundamental
law of the state.</p>

<p>So in the act of 1818, chapter 67, section 4, authorizing
Illinois to become a state.</p>

<p>So in the act of 1805, chapter 5, section 2, establishing
the Territory of Michigan.</p>

<p>So of Wisconsin. See act of 1847, chapter 53, in
connection with the constitution of Wisconsin.</p>

<p>But all this is tedious and superfluous. I have gone
into this detail, because I understand the gentleman
from Virginia [Mr. <span class="smcap">Bayly</span>] to have denied this adoption
and these recognitions of the ordinance. I hazard
nothing in saying that the ordinance of 1787 has been
expressly referred to as valid, or expressly or impliedly
reënacted, a dozen times, by the Congress of the United
States; and, in the state courts of Ohio, Illinois, Louisiana,
Mississippi, and Missouri, it has been adjudged
to be constitutional. How, then, is it possible for any
mind, amenable to legal rules for the decision of legal
questions, to say that Congress cannot legislate, or has
not legislated, (except once or twice inadvertently,) on
the subject of slavery in the territories?</p>

<p>On this part of the argument, I have only a concluding
remark to submit. The position I am contesting
affirms generally that Congress cannot legislate
upon the subject of slavery in the territories. The
<i>inexpediency</i> of so legislating is further advocated on
the ground that it is repugnant to democratical principles
to debar the inhabitants of the territories from
governing themselves. Must the free men of the territories,
it is asked, have laws made for them by others?
No! It is anti-democratic, monarchical, intolerable.
All men have the right of self-government;
and this principle holds true with regard to the inhabitants
of territories, as well as the inhabitants of
states.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_26">[Pg 26]</span></p>

<p>Now, if these declarations were a sincere and honest
affirmation of human rights, I should respect them and
honor their authors. Did this doctrine grow out of a
jealousy for the rights of man, a fear of usurpation, an
assertion of the principle of self-government, I should
sympathize with it, while I denied its legality. But,
sir, it is the most painful aspect of this whole case,
that the very object and purpose of claiming these
ample and sovereign rights for the inhabitants of the
territories is, that they may deny <i>all</i> rights to a portion
of their fellow-beings within them. Enlarge,
aggrandize, the rights of the territorial settlers! And
why? Because, by so doing, you enable them to abolish
all rights for a whole class of human beings. This
claim, then, is not made for the purpose of making
freemen more free, but for making slaves more enslaved.
The reason for denying to Congress the power
to legislate for the territories, is the fear that Congress
will prevent slavery in them. The reason for claiming
the supreme right of legislation for the territorial
inhabitants, is the hope that they will establish slavery
within their borders. Must not that democracy be
false which begets slavery as its natural offspring?</p>

<hr class="tb">

<p>If it has now been demonstrated that Congress has
uniformly legislated, and can legislate, on the subject
of slavery in the territories, I proceed to consider the
next question. <i>Is it expedient to exclude slavery from
them?</i></p>

<p>Here, on the threshold, we are confronted with the
claim that the gates shall be thrown wide open to the
admission of slavery into the broad western world;
because, otherwise, the southern or slave states would
be debarred from enjoying their share of the common
property of the Union.</p>

<p>I meet this claim with a counter-claim. If, on the
one hand, the consecration of this soil to freedom will<span class="pagenum" id="Page_27">[Pg 27]</span>
exclude the slaveholders of the south, it is just as true,
on the other hand, that the desecration of it to slavery
will exclude the freemen of the north. We, at the
north, know too well the foundations of worldly prosperity
and happiness; we know too well the sources
of social and moral welfare, ever voluntarily to blend
our fortunes with those of a community where slavery
is tolerated. If our demand for free territory, then,
excludes them, their demand for slave territory excludes
us. Not one in five hundred of the freemen
of the north could ever be induced to take his family
and domicile himself in a territory where slavery exists.
They know that the institution would impoverish their
estate, demoralize their children, and harrow their own
consciences with an ever-present sense of guilt, until
those consciences, by force of habit and induration,
should pass into that callous and more deplorable state,
where continuous crime could be committed without
the feeling of remorse.</p>

<p>Sir, let me read a passage from Dr. Channing, written
in 1798,—fifty years ago,—when, at the early
age of nineteen, he lived for some time in Richmond,
Virginia, as a tutor in a private family. While there,
he wrote a letter, of which the following is an extract:—</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>“There is one object here which always depresses me. It
is <i>slavery</i>. This alone would prevent me from ever settling
in Virginia. Language cannot express my detestation of it.
Master and slave! Nature never made such a distinction, or
established such a relation. Man, when forced to substitute
the will of another for his own, ceases to be a moral agent;
his title to the name of man is extinguished; he becomes a
mere machine in the hands of his oppressor. No empire is
so valuable as the empire of one’s self. No right is so inseparable
from humanity, and so necessary to the improvement
of our species, as the right of exerting the powers which
nature has given us in the pursuit of any and of every good
which we can obtain without doing injury to others. Should<span class="pagenum" id="Page_28">[Pg 28]</span>
you desire it, I will give you some idea of the situation and
character of the negroes in Virginia. It is a subject so degrading
to humanity, that I cannot dwell on it with pleasure.
I should be obliged to show you every vice, heightened by
every meanness, and added to every misery. The influence
of slavery on the whites is almost as fatal as on the blacks
themselves.”</p>
</div>

<p>This was written fifty years ago, by a young man
from New England, only nineteen years old. I know
that, on all subjects of philanthropy and ethics, Dr.
Channing was half a century in advance of his age.
But the sentiments he expressed on this subject, at the
close of the last century, are now the prevalent, deep-seated
feelings of northern men, excepting, perhaps, a
few cases where these feelings have been corrupted by
interest.</p>

<p>I repeat, then, that the north cannot shut out the
south from the new territories by a law for excluding
slavery, more effectually than the south will shut out
the north by the fact of introducing slavery. Even
admitting, then, that the <i>law</i> is equal for both north
and south, I will show that all the <i>equity</i> is on the
side of the north.</p>

<p>Sir, from the establishment of our independence by
the treaty of 1783 to the time of the adoption of the
constitution, and for years afterwards, no trace is to
be found of an intention to enlarge the bounds of our
republic; and it is well known that the treaty of 1803,
for acquiring Louisiana, was acknowledged by Mr.
Jefferson, who made it, to be unconstitutional. In
1787, the Magna Charta of perpetual freedom was secured
to the North-west Territory. But the article excluding
slavery from it had an earlier date than 1787.
On the 1st of March, 1784, Congress voted to accept
a session from the state of Virginia of her claim to
the territory north-west of the Ohio river. The subject
of providing a government for this and other territory<span class="pagenum" id="Page_29">[Pg 29]</span>
was referred to a committee consisting of Mr.
Jefferson, Mr. Chase of Maryland, and Mr. Howell of
Rhode Island. On the 19th of April, 1784, their report
was considered. That report contained the
following ever-memorable clause:—</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>“That after the year 1800, of the Christian era, there shall
be neither slavery nor involuntary servitude in any of the
said states, [they were spoken of as states, because it was
always contemplated to erect the territories into states,] otherwise
than in punishment of crimes whereof the party shall
have been convicted to have been personally guilty.”</p>
</div>

<p>Sir, we hear much said in our day of the Wilmot
proviso against slavery. In former years, great credit
has been given to Mr. Nathan Dane, of Massachusetts,
for originating the sixth article, (against slavery), in the
ordinance of 1787. Sir, it is a misnomer to call this
restrictive clause the “Wilmot proviso.” It is the
<i>Jefferson proviso</i>, and Mr. Jefferson should have the
honor of it; and would to Heaven that our southern
friends, who kneel so devoutly at his shrine, could be
animated by that lofty spirit of freedom, that love for
the rights of man, which alone can make their acts of
devotion sacred.</p>

<p>But what is most material to be observed here is,
that the plan of government reported by Mr. Jefferson,
and acted upon by the Congress at that time, embraced
all the “western territory.” It embraced all the “territory
ceded, or <i>to be ceded</i>, by individual states to the
United States.”—See <i>Journals of Congress, April 23,
1784</i>. If, then, we leave out Kentucky and Tennessee,
as being parts of Virginia and North Carolina, all
the residue of the territory north <i>or south</i> of the Ohio
river, within the treaty limits of the United States, was
intended, by the “Jefferson proviso,” to be rescued
from the doom of slavery. For that proviso there
were sixteen votes, and only seven against it. Yet so
singularly were these seven votes distributed, and so<span class="pagenum" id="Page_30">[Pg 30]</span>
large a majority of the states did it require to pass
an act, that it was lost. The whole of the representation
from seven states voted for it unanimously.
Only two states voted unanimously against
it. Had but one of Mr. Jefferson’s colleagues voted
with him, and had Mr. Spaight, of North Carolina,
voted for it, the restrictive clause in the report would
have stood. But a minority of seven from the slaveholding
states controlled a majority of sixteen from the
free states,—ominous even at that early day of a fate
that has now relentlessly pursued us for sixty years.</p>

<p>That vote was certainly no more than a fair representation
of the feeling of the country against slavery
at that time. It was with such a feeling that the
“compromises of the constitution,” as they are called,
were entered into. Nobody dreaded or dreamed of
the extension of slavery beyond its then existing limits.
Yet, behold its aggressive march! Besides Kentucky
and Tennessee, which I omit, for reasons before
intimated, seven new slave states have been added to
the Union,—Mississippi, Alabama, Missouri, Arkansas,
Louisiana, Florida, and Texas,—the last five out of
territory not belonging to us at the adoption of the
constitution; while only one free state, Iowa, has been
added during all this time, out of such newly-acquired
territory.<a id="FNanchor_2" href="#Footnote_2" class="fnanchor">[2]</a></p>
<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_31">[Pg 31]</span></p>
<p>But there is another fact, which shows that the
slaveholders have already had their full share of territory,
however wide the boundaries of this country may
hereafter become.</p>

<p>I have seen the number of <i>actual slaveholders</i> variously
estimated; but the highest estimate I have
ever seen is <i>three hundred thousand</i>. Allowing six
persons to a family, this number would represent a white
population of eighteen hundred thousand.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Gayle</span>, of Alabama, interrupted and said: If the
gentleman from Massachusetts has been informed that
the number of slaveholders is only 300,000, then I
will tell him his information is utterly false.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Mann</span>. Will the gentleman tell me how many
there are?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Gayle</span>. Ten times as many.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Mann</span>. Ten times as many! Ten times
300,000 is 3,000,000; and allowing six persons to each
family, this would give a population of 18,000,000
directly connected with slaveholding; while the whole
free population of the south, in 1840, was considerably
less than five millions!</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Meade</span>, of Virginia, here interposed and said,
that where the father or mother owned slaves, they were
considered the joint property of the family. I think,
if you include the grown and the young, there are
about three millions interested in slave property.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Mann</span> resumed. My data lead me to believe that
the number does not now exceed two millions; but, at
the time of the adoption of the constitution, the number
directly connected with slaveholding must have
been less than one million. Yet this one million have<span class="pagenum" id="Page_32">[Pg 32]</span>
already managed to acquire the broad States of Missouri,
Arkansas, Louisiana, Florida, and Texas, beyond
the limits of the treaty of 1783; when, at the time
the “compromises of the constitution” were entered
into, not one of the parties supposed that we should
ever acquire territory beyond those limits. And this
has been done for the benefit, (if it be a benefit,)
of that one million of slaveholders, against what is now
a free population of fifteen millions. And, in addition
to this, it is to be considered that the non-slaveholding
population of the slave states have as direct and deep
an interest as any part of the country, adverse to the
extension of slavery. If all our new territory be
doomed to slavery, where can the non-slaveholders of
the slaveholding states emigrate to? Are they not to
be considered? Has one half the population of the
slaveholding states rights, which are paramount, not
only to the rights of the other half, but to the rights
of all the free states besides? for such is the claim.
No, sir. I say that, if slavery were no moral or political
evil, yet, according to all principles of justice and
equity, the slaveholders have already obtained their
full share of territory, though all the residue of this
continent were to be annexed to the Union, and we
were to become, in the insane language of the day,
“an ocean-bound republic.”</p>

<p>I now proceed to consider the nature and effects of
slavery, as a reason why new-born communities should
be exempted from it. First, let me treat of its economical
or financial, and, secondly, of its moral
aspects.</p>

<p>Though slaves are said to be property, they are the
preventers, the wasters, the antagonists of property.
So far from facilitating the increase of individual or
national wealth, slavery retards both. It blasts worldly
prosperity. Other things being equal, a free people
will thrive and prosper, in a mere worldly sense, more<span class="pagenum" id="Page_33">[Pg 33]</span>
than a people divided into masters and slaves. Were
we so constituted as to care for nothing, to aspire to
nothing, beyond mere temporal well being, this well
being would counsel us to abolish slavery wherever it
exists, and to repel its approach wherever it threatens.</p>

<p>Enslave a man, and you destroy his ambition, his
enterprise, his capacity. In the constitution of human
nature, the desire of bettering one’s condition is the
mainspring of effort. The first touch of slavery snaps
this spring. The slave does not participate in the
value of the wealth he creates. All he earns another
seizes. A free man labors, not only to improve his
own condition, but to better the condition of his
children. The mighty impulse of parental affection
repays for diligence, and makes exertion sweet. The
slave’s heart never beats with this high emotion.
However industrious and frugal he may be, he has
nothing to bequeath to his children,—or nothing save
the sad bonds he himself has worn. Fear may make
him work, but hope—never. When he moves his
tardy limbs, it is because of the suffering that goads him
from behind, and not from the bright prospects that
beckon him forward in the race.</p>

<p>What would a slave owner at the south think, should
he come to Massachusetts, and there see a farmer seize
upon his hired man, call in a surgeon, and cut off all
the flexor muscles of his arms and legs? I do not ask
what he would think of his humanity, but what would
he think of his sanity? Yet the planter does more
than this when he makes a man a slave. He cuts
deeper than the muscles; he destroys the spirit that
moves the muscles.</p>

<p>In all ages of the world, among all nations, wherever
the earnings of the laborer have been stolen from
him, his energies have gone with his earnings. Under
the villeinage system of England, the villeins were a
low, idle, spiritless race; dead to responsibility; grovelling<span class="pagenum" id="Page_34">[Pg 34]</span>
in their desires; resistant of labor; without enterprise;
without foresight. This principle is now
exemplified in the landlord and tenant system of
Ireland. If a tenant is to be no better off for the improvements
he makes on an estate, he will not make
the improvements. Look at the seigniories of New
York,—the anti-rent districts as they are now called;—every
man acquainted with the subject knows that
both people and husbandry are half a century behind
the condition of contiguous fee-simple proprietorships.
All history illustrates the principle, that when property
is insecure, it will not be earned. If a despot can
seize and confiscate the property of his subject at
pleasure, the subject will not acquire property, and
thereby give to himself the conspicuousness that invites
the plunder. And if this be so when property is
merely insecure, what must be the effect when a man
has no property whatever in his earnings? Who does
not know that a slave, who can rationally hope to purchase
his freedom, will do all the work he ever did
before, and earn his freedom-money besides? Slavery,
therefore, though claiming to be a kind of property, is
the bane of property; and the more slaves there are
found in the inventory of a nation’s wealth, the less in
value will the aggregate of that inventory be.</p>

<p>This is <i>one</i> of the reasons why slave labor is so
much less efficient than free labor. The former can
never compete with the latter; and while the greater
service is performed with cheerfulness, the smaller is
extorted by fear. Just as certain as that the locomotive
can outrun the horse, and the lightning outspeed
the locomotive, just so certain is it that he who is animated
by the hopes and the rewards of freedom will
outstrip the disheartened and fear-driven slave.</p>

<p>The intelligent freeman can afford to live well, dress
decently, and occupy a comfortable tenement. A
scanty subsistence, a squalid garb, a mean and dilapidated<span class="pagenum" id="Page_35">[Pg 35]</span>
hovel, proclaim the degradation of the slave.
The slave states gain millions of dollars every year
from the privations, the mean food, clothing, and shelter
to which the slaves are subjected; and yet they grow
rich less rapidly than states where millions of dollars
are annually expended for the comforts and conveniences
of the laborer. More is lost in production than
is gained by privation.</p>

<p>A universal concomitant of slavery is, that it makes
white labor disreputable. Being disreputable, it is
shunned. The pecuniary loss resulting from this is
incalculable. Dry up the myriad headsprings of the
Mississippi, and where would be the mighty volume
of waters which now bear navies on their bosom, and
lift the ocean itself above its level, by their outpouring
flood? Abolish those sources of wealth, which consist
in the personal industry of every man, and of each
member of every man’s family, and that wide-spread
thrift, and competence, and elegance, which are both
the reward and the stimulus of labor, will be abolished
with them. Forego the means, and you forfeit the
end. You must use the instrument if you would have
the product. Nothing but the feeling of independence,
the conscious security of working for one’s self and
one’s family, will, in the present state of the world,
make labor profitable.</p>

<p>I know it has been recently said in this capital, and
by high authority, that, with the exception of menial
services, it is not disreputable at the south for a white
man to labor. There are two ways, each independent
of the other, to disprove this assertion. One of them
consists in the testimony of a host of intelligent witnesses
acquainted with the condition of things at the
south. I might quote page after page from various
sources; but, as the assertion comes from a gentleman
belonging to South Carolina, [Mr. <span class="smcap">Calhoun</span>, of the
Senate,] I will meet it with the statement of another<span class="pagenum" id="Page_36">[Pg 36]</span>
gentleman belonging to the same state. I refer to Mr.
William Gregg, of Charleston, a gentleman who is extensively
acquainted with the social condition of men,
both north and south.</p>

<p>In that state, according to the last census, there
were about 150,000 free whites <i>over twelve years of
age</i>. “Of this class,” says Mr. Gregg, “fifty thousand
are non-producers.”<a id="FNanchor_3" href="#Footnote_3" class="fnanchor">[3]</a> I suppose South Carolina
to be as thrifty a slave state as there is, perhaps excepting
Georgia; yet here is one third part of the population,
old enough to work and able to work, who are
idle, and of course vicious,—non-producers, but the
worst kind of consumers.</p>

<p>Another answer to the above assertion is, that if
white labor were reputable at the south, and white
men were industrious, the whole country would be a
garden,—a terrestrial paradise,—so far as neatness,
abundance, and beauty are concerned. <i>Where are the</i>
<span class="allsmcap">RESULTS</span> <i>of this respected and honored white labor</i>?
In a country where few expenses are necessary to
ward off the rigors of winter; where the richest staples
of the world are produced; where cattle and
flocks need but little shelter, and sometimes none; if
man superadded his industry to the bounties of nature,
want would be wholly unknown, competence would
give place to opulence, and the highest decorations of
art would mingle with the glowing beauties of nature.</p>

<p>But hear Mr. Gregg:—</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>“My recent visit to the northern states has fully satisfied
me that the true secret of our difficulties lies in the want of
energy on the part of our capitalists, and ignorance and laziness
on the part of those who ought to labor. We need
never look for thrift while we permit our immense timber forests,
granite quarries, and mines to lie idle, and supply ourselves
with hewn granite, pine boards, laths, shingles, &amp;c.,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_37">[Pg 37]</span>
furnished by the <i>lazy</i> dogs of the north. Ah! worse than
this; we see our back-country farmers, many of whom
are too lazy to mend a broken gate, or repair the fences to
protect their crops from the neighboring stock, actually supplied
with their axe, hoe, and broom handles, pitchforks,
rakes, &amp;c., by the <i>indolent</i> mountaineers of New Hampshire
and Massachusetts. The time was, when every old woman
had her gourd, from which the country gardens were supplied
with seed. We now find it more convenient to permit this
duty to devolve on our careful friends, the Yankees. Even
our boat oars, and handspikes for rolling logs, are furnished,
ready-made, to our hand,” &amp;c. “Need I add, to further exemplify
our excessive indolence, that the Charleston market
is supplied with fish and wild game by northern men, who
come out here as regularly as the winter comes, for this purpose,
and from our own waters and forests often realize, in
the course of one winter, a sufficiency to purchase a small
farm in New England.”—<i>Essays</i>, page 8.</p>
</div>

<p>Again:—</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>“It is only necessary to travel over the sterile mountains of
Connecticut, Massachusetts, Vermont, and New Hampshire, to
learn the true secret of our difficulties,”—“to learn the difference
between indolence and industry, extravagance and economy.
We there see the scenery which would take the place of
our unpainted mansions, dilapidated cabins, with mud chimneys,
and no windows, broken-down rail fences, fields overgrown
with weeds, and thrown away half exhausted, to be taken up by
pine thickets; beef cattle unprotected from the inclemency of
winter, and so poor as barely to preserve life.”—<i>Essays</i>, page 7.</p>
</div>

<p>And again:—</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>“Shall we pass unnoticed the thousands of poor, ignorant,
degraded white people among us, who, in this land of plenty,
live in comparative nakedness and starvation? Many a one
is reared in <i>proud</i> South Carolina, from birth to manhood,
who has never passed a month in which he has not, some
part of the time, been stinted for meat. Many a mother is
there who will tell you that her children are but scantily supplied
with bread, and much more scantily with meat, and if<span class="pagenum" id="Page_38">[Pg 38]</span>
they be clad with comfortable raiment, it is at the expense
of these scanty allowances of food. These may be startling
statements, but they are nevertheless true; and if not believed
in Charleston, the members of our legislature, who have traversed
the state in electioneering campaigns, can attest their
truth.”—<i>Essays</i>, page 22.</p>
</div>

<p>After such statements as these; after the testimony
of hundreds and hundreds of eye-witnesses; after the
proofs furnished by the aggregates of products, published
in our Patent Office Reports, it is drawing a little
too heavily on our credulity to say that the white
man at the south is industrious. Industry manifests
itself by its results, as the sun manifests itself by
shining.</p>

<p>But slavery is hostile to the pecuniary advancement
of the community in another way. The slave must
be kept in ignorance. He must not be educated, lest
with education should come a knowledge of his natural
rights, and the means of escape or the power of
vengeance. To secure the abolition of his freedom,
the growth of his mind must be abolished. His education,
therefore, is prohibited by statute under terrible
penalties.</p>

<p>Now, a man is weak in his muscles; he is strong
only in his faculties. In physical strength how much
superior is an ox or a horse to a man; in fleetness, the
dromedary or the eagle. It is through mental strength
only that man becomes the superior and governor of
all animals.</p>

<p>It was not the design of Providence that the work
of the world should be performed by muscular strength.
God has filled the earth and imbued the elements with
energies of greater power than that of all the inhabitants
of a thousand planets like ours. Whence come
our necessaries and our luxuries?—those comforts and
appliances that make the difference between a houseless,
wandering tribe of Indians in the far west, and a<span class="pagenum" id="Page_39">[Pg 39]</span>
New England village. They do not come wholly or
principally from the original, unassisted strength of
the human arm, but from the employment, through intelligence
and skill, of those great natural forces with
which the bountiful Creator has filled every part of the
material universe. Caloric, gravitation, expansibility,
compressibility, electricity, chemical affinities and repulsions,
spontaneous velocities,—these are the mighty
agents which the intellect of man harnesses to the car
of improvement. The application of water, and wind,
and steam, to the propulsion of machinery, and to the
transportation of men and merchandise from place to
place, has added ten thousand fold to the actual products
of human industry. How small the wheel which
the stoutest laborer can turn, and how soon will he be
weary! Compare this with a wheel driving a thousand
spindles or looms, which a stream of water can
turn, and never tire. A locomotive will take five hundred
men, and bear them on their journey hundreds
of miles in a day. Look at these same five hundred
men, starting from the same point, and attempting the
same distance, with all the pedestrian’s or the equestrian’s
toil and tardiness. The cotton mills of Massachusetts
will turn out more cloth, in one day, than
could have been manufactured by all the inhabitants
of the eastern continent during the tenth century.
On an element which, in ancient times, was supposed
to be exclusively within the control of the gods, and
where it was deemed impious for human power to intrude,
even there the gigantic forces of nature, which
human science and skill have enlisted in their service,
confront and overcome the raging of the elements,—breasting
tempests and tides, escaping reefs and lee
shores, and careering triumphant around the globe.
The velocity of winds, the weight of waters, and the
rage of steam, are powers, each one of which is infinitely
stronger than all the strength of all the nations<span class="pagenum" id="Page_40">[Pg 40]</span>
and races of mankind, were it all gathered into a single
arm. And all these energies are given us on one
condition,—the condition of intelligence, that is, of
education.</p>

<p>Had God intended that the work of the world
should be done by human bones and sinews, he would
have given us an arm as solid and strong as the shaft
of a steam engine; and enabled us to stand, day and
night, and turn the crank of a steamship while sailing
to Liverpool or Calcutta. Had God designed the human
muscles to do the work of the world, then, instead
of the ingredients of gunpowder or gun cotton,
and the expansive force of heat, he would have given
us hands which could take a granite quarry and break
its solid acres into suitable and symmetrical blocks, as
easily as we now open an orange. Had he intended
us for bearing burdens, he would have given us Atlantean
shoulders, by which we could carry the vast
freights of rail-car and steamship, as a porter carries
his pack. He would have given us lungs by which
we could blow fleets before us, and wings to sweep
over ocean wastes. But, instead of iron arms, and
Atlantean shoulders, and the lungs of Boreas, he
has given us a mind, a soul, a capacity of acquiring
knowledge, and thus of appropriating all these energies
of nature to our own use. Instead of a telescopic
and microscopic eye, he has given us power to invent
the telescope and the microscope. Instead of ten thousand
fingers, he has given us genius inventive of the
power loom and the printing press. Without a cultivated
intellect, man is among the weakest of all the
dynamical forces of nature; with a cultivated intellect,
he commands them all.</p>

<p>And now, what does the slave maker do? He abolishes
this mighty power of the intellect, and uses only
the weak, degraded, and half-animated forces of the
human limbs. A thousand slaves may stand by a river,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_41">[Pg 41]</span>
and to them it is only an object of fear or of superstition.
An educated man surpasses the ancient idea of
a river god; he stands by the Penobscot, the Kennebec,
the Merrimack, or the Connecticut; he commands
each of them to do more work than could be
performed by a hundred thousand men,—to saw timber,
to make cloth, to grind corn,—and they obey.
Ignorant slaves stand upon a coal mine, and to them
it is only a worthless part of the inanimate earth. An
educated man uses the same mine to print a million of
books. Slaves will seek to obtain the same crop from
the same field, year after year, though the <i>pabulum</i>
of that crop is exhausted; the educated man, with his
chemist’s eye, sees not only the minutest atoms of
earth, but the imponderable gases that permeate it, and
he is rewarded with an unbroken succession of luxuriant
harvests.</p>

<p>Nor are these advantages confined to those departments
of nature where her mightiest forces are brought
into requisition. In accomplishing whatever requires
delicacy and precision, nature is as much more perfect
than man as she is more powerful in whatever requires
strength. Whether in great or in small operations, all
the improvements in the mechanical and the useful
arts come as directly from intelligence as a bird comes
out of a shell, or the beautiful colors of a flower out
of sunshine. The slave worker is forever prying at
the short end of Nature’s lever, and using the back
instead of the edge of her finest instruments.</p>

<p>Sir, the most abundant proof exists, derived from all
departments of human industry, that uneducated labor
is comparatively unprofitable labor. I have before me
the statements of a number of the most intelligent
gentlemen of Massachusetts, affirming this fact as the
result of an experience extending over many years.
In Massachusetts we have no native-born child wholly
without school instruction; but the degrees of attainment,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_42">[Pg 42]</span>
of mental development, are various. Half a
dozen years ago, the Secretary of the Massachusetts
Board of Education obtained statements from large
numbers of our master manufacturers, authenticated
from the books of their respective establishments, and
covering a series of years, the result of which was,
that increased wages were found in connection with
increased intelligence, just as certainly as increased
heat raises the mercury in the thermometer. Foreigners,
and those coming from other states, who made
their marks when they receipted their bills, earned the
least; those who had a moderate or limited education
occupied a middle ground on the pay-roll; while the
intelligent young women who worked in the mills in
winter, and taught schools in summer, crowned the
list. The larger capital, in the form of intelligence,
yielded the larger interest in the form of wages. This
inquiry was not confined to manufactures, but was extended
to other departments of business, where the
results of labor could be made the subject of exact
measurement.</p>

<p>This is universally so. The mechanic sees it, when
he compares the work of a stupid with that of an
awakened mind. The traveller sees it, when he
passes from an educated into an uneducated nation.
Sir, I have seen countries in Europe, lying side by side,
where, without compass or chart, without bound or
landmark, I could run the line of demarcation between
the two, by the broad, legible characters which ignorance
has written on roads, fields, houses, and the persons
of men, women, and children, on one side, and
which knowledge has inscribed on the other.</p>

<p>This difference is most striking in the mechanic
arts, but it is clearly visible also in husbandry. Not
the most fertile soil, not mines of silver and gold, can
make a nation rich, without intelligence. Who ever
had a more fertile soil than the Egyptians? Who<span class="pagenum" id="Page_43">[Pg 43]</span>
have handled more silver and gold than the Spaniards?
The universal cultivation of the mind and
heart is the only true source of opulence;—the cultivation
of the mind, by which to lay hold on the treasures
of nature; the cultivation of the heart, by which
to devote those treasures to beneficent uses. Where
this cultivation exists, no matter how barren the soil
or ungenial the clime, there comfort and competence
will abound; for it is the intellectual and moral condition
of the cultivator that impoverishes the soil or
makes it teem with abundance. He who disobeys the
law of God in regard to the culture of the intellectual
and spiritual nature, may live in the valley of the
Nile, but he can rear only the “lean kine” of Pharaoh;
but he who obeys the highest law may dwell in the
cold and inhospitable regions of Scotland or of New
England, and “well-formed and fat-fleshed kine” shall
feed on all his meadows. If Pharaoh will be a taskmaster,
and will not let the bondmen go free, the corn
in his field shall be the “seven thin ears blasted by
the east wind;” but if he will obey the commandments
of the Lord, then behold there shall be “seven
ears of corn upon one stalk, all rank and good.” Sir,
the sweat of a slave poisons the soil upon which it
falls; his breath is mildew to every green thing; his
tear withers the verdure it drops upon.</p>

<p>But slavery makes the general education of the
whites impossible. You cannot have general education
without Common Schools. Common Schools cannot
exist where the population is sparse. Where
slaves till the soil, or do the principal part of whatever
work is done, the free population must be sparse.
Slavery, then, by an inexorable law, denies general
education to the whites. The providence of God is
just and retributive. Create a serf caste, and debar
them from education, and you necessarily debar a
great portion of the privileged class from education<span class="pagenum" id="Page_44">[Pg 44]</span>
also. It is impossible, in the present state of things,
or in any state of things which can be foreseen, to
have free and universal education in a slave state.
The difficulty is insurmountable. For a well-organized
system of Common Schools, there should be two
hundred children, at least, living in such proximity to
each other that the oldest of them can come together
to a central school. It is not enough to gather from
within a circle of half a dozen miles’ diameter fifty
or sixty children for a single school. This brings all
ages and all studies into the same room. A good system
requires a separation of school children into four,
or at least into three, classes, according to ages and attainments.
Without this gradation, a school is bereft
of more than half its efficiency. Now, this can never
be done in an agricultural community where there are
two classes of men—one to do all the work, and the
other to seize all the profits. With New England
habits of industry, and with that diversified labor
which would be sure to spring from intelligence, the
State of Virginia, which skirts us here on the south,
would support all the population of the New England
states, and fill them with abundance.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Bayly</span>. We have as great a population as New
England now.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Mann</span>. As great a population as New England!!</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Bayly</span>. We send fifteen representatives.</p>

<p>[A voice. And how many of them represent
slaves?]</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Mann</span>. Massachusetts alone sends ten representatives.</p>

<p>[A voice. And the rest of New England twenty-one
more.]</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Mann</span>. I say, sir, the single State of Virginia
could support in abundance the whole population of
New England. With such a free population, the
school children would be so numerous that public<span class="pagenum" id="Page_45">[Pg 45]</span>
schools might be opened within three or four miles of
each other all over its territory,—the light of each
of which, blending with its neighboring lights, would
illumine the whole land. They would be schools,
too, in point of cheapness, within every man’s means.
The degrading idea of pauper schools would be discarded
forever. But what is the condition of Virginia
now? One quarter part of all its adult free white
population are unable to read or write, and were proclaimed
to be so by a late governor, in his annual message,
without producing any reform. Their remedy
is to choose a governor who will not proclaim such a
fact. When has Virginia, in any state or national
election, given a majority equal to the number of its
voters unable to read or write? A <i>republican</i> government
supported by the two pillars of Slavery and Ignorance!</p>

<p>In South Carolina there is also a fund for the support
of pauper schools; but this had become so useless,
and was so disdained by its objects, that a late governor
of the state, in his annual message, recommended that
it should be withdrawn from them altogether.</p>

<p>Yet in many of the slave states there are beautiful
paper systems of Common Schools,—dead laws in the
statute books,—and the census tells us how profitless
they have been. In 1840, in the fifteen slave states
and territories, there were only 201,085 scholars at the
primary schools. In the same class of schools in the
free states, there were 1,626,028,—eight times as
many. New York alone had 502,367, or two and a
half times as many. The scholars in the primary
schools of Ohio alone, outnumbered all those in the fifteen
slave states and territories by more than 17,000.
In the slave states, almost one tenth part of the free
white population over twenty years of age are unable
to read and write. In the free states, less than one in
one hundred and fifty; and at least four fifths of these<span class="pagenum" id="Page_46">[Pg 46]</span>
are foreigners, who ought not to be included in the
computation. Many of the slave states, too, have
munificent school funds. Kentucky has one of more
than a million of dollars; Tennessee, of two millions;
yet, in 1837, Governor Clarke, of Kentucky, declared,
in his message to the legislature, that “one third of
the adult population were unable to write their names;”
and in the State of Tennessee, according to the last
census, there were 58,531 of the same description of
persons. Surely it would take more than five of these
to make three freemen; for the more a state has of
them, the less of intelligent freedom will there be in it.
And if the schools in the slave states are compared with
the schools in the free states, the deficiency in quality
will be found as great as the deficiency in number.</p>

<p>Sir, during the last ten years I have had a most extensive
correspondence with the intelligent friends of
education in the slave states. They yearn for progress,
but they cannot obtain it. They procure laws to be
passed, but there is no one to execute them. They
set forth the benefits and the blessings of education;
but they speak in a vacuum, and no one hears the appeal.
If a parent wishes to educate his children, he
must send them from home, and thus suffer a sort of
bereavement, even while they live; or he must employ
a tutor or governess in his family, which few are able
to do. The rich may do it, but what becomes of the
children of the poor? In cities the obstacles are less;
but the number of persons resident in cities is relatively
small. All this is the inevitable consequence of
slavery; and it is as impossible for free, thorough,
universal education to coëxist with slavery as for two
bodies to occupy the same space at the same time.
Slavery would abolish education, if it should invade a
free state; education would abolish slavery, if it <i>could</i>
invade a slave state.</p>

<p>Destroying common education, slavery destroys the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_47">[Pg 47]</span>
fruits of common education,—the inventive mind,
practical talent, the power of adapting means to ends
in the business of life. Whence have come all those
mechanical and scientific improvements and inventions
which have enriched the world with so many
comforts, and adorned it with so many beauties; which
to-day give enjoyments and luxuries to a common
family in a New England village, that neither Queen
Elizabeth of England nor any of her proud court ever
dreamed of, but a little more than two centuries ago?
Among whom have these improvements originated?
All history and experience affirm that they have come,
and must come, from people among whom education is
most generous and unconfined. Increase the <i>constituency</i>,
if I may so speak, of developed intellect, and
you increase in an equal ratio the chances of inventive,
creative genius. From what part of our own country
has come the application of steam to the propulsion
of boats for commercial purposes, or of wheels for
manufacturing purposes? Where have the various and
almost infinite improvements been made which have
resulted in the present perfection of cotton and woollen
machinery? Whence came the invention of the
cotton-gin, and the great improvements in railroads?
Where was born the mighty genius who invented the
first lightning rod, which sends the electric fluid harmless
into the earth; or that other genius, not less beneficent,
who invented the second lightning rod, which
sends the same fluid from city to city on messages of
business or of affection? Sir, these are results which
you can no more have without common education,
without imbuing the public mind with the elements of
knowledge, than you can have corn without planting,
or harvests without sunshine.</p>

<p>Look into the Patent Office reports, and see in what
sections of country mechanical improvements and the
application of science to the useful arts have originated.<span class="pagenum" id="Page_48">[Pg 48]</span>
Out of <i>five hundred and seventy-two</i> patents issued in
1847, only <i>sixty-six</i> went to the slave states. The
patents annually issued, it is true, are a mingled heap
of chaff and wheat, but some of it is wheat worthy of
Olympus. I think the Patent Office reports show that
at least six or eight times as many patents have been
taken out for the north as for the south. What
improvements will a slave ever make in agricultural
implements; in the manufacture of metals; in preparing
wool, cotton, silk, fur, or paper; in chemical
processes; in the application of steam; in philosophical,
nautical, or optical instruments; in civil engineering,
architecture, the construction of roads, canals,
wharves, bridges, docks, piers, &amp;c.; in hydraulics or
pneumatics; in the application of the mechanical
powers; in household furniture, or wearing apparel;
in printing, binding, engraving, &amp;c., &amp;c.? This question,
when put in reference to slaves, appears ridiculous;
and yet it is no more absurd, when asked in reference
to an ignorant slave, than when asked in
reference to an uneducated white man. The fact that
the latter is a voter makes no difference, notwithstanding
the common opinion, in certain latitudes, that it
does. All such improvements come from minds which
have had an early awakening, and been put on scientific
trains of thought in their childhood and youth,—a
thing utterly impossible for the people at large, without
Common Schools.</p>

<p>These are causes; now look at effects. In the
New England states, the iron manufacture is twenty
times as much, according to the population, as it is in
Virginia; and yet Virginia has far more of the ore than
they. In cotton, we can hardly find a fraction low
enough to express the difference. The ship-building
in Maine and Massachusetts is thirty-five times as much
as in Virginia. The north comes to the south, cuts
their timber, carries it home, manufactures it, and then<span class="pagenum" id="Page_49">[Pg 49]</span>
brings it back, wrought into a hundred different forms,
to be sold to those who would see it rot before their
eyes.</p>

<p>Can any man give a reason why Norfolk should not
have grown like New York, other than the difference
in the institutions of the people? Jamestown was
settled before Plymouth, and had <i>natural</i> advantages
superior to it. Plymouth now has a population of between
seven and eight thousand, is worth two millions
of dollars, and taxed itself last year, for schools and
schoolhouses, more than seven thousand dollars. I
ought rather to say, that it invested more than seven
thousand dollars in a kind of stock that yields a hundred
per cent. income. How many bats there may be
in the ruins of Jamestown, the last census does not inform
us.</p>

<p>The books printed at the south I suppose not to
be equal to <i>one fiftieth</i> part of the number printed
at the north. In maps, charts, engravings, and so forth,
the elements of comparison exist only on one side.</p>

<p>Out of universal education come genius, skill, and
enterprise, and the desire of bettering one’s condition.
Industry and frugality are their concomitants. Diversified
labor secures a home market. Diligence earns
much, but the absence of the vices of indolence saves
more. Hence comforts abound, while capital accumulates.
After the home consumption is supplied, there
is a surplus for export. The balance of trade is favorable.
All the higher institutions of learning and religion
can be liberally supported. These institutions
impart an elevated and moral tone to society. Hence
efforts for all kinds of social ameliorations. Temperance
societies spring up. Societies for preventing
crime; for saving from pauperism; for the reform of
prisons and the reformation of prisoners; for peace;
for sending missionaries to the heathen; for diffusing
the gospel,—all these, where a sound education is<span class="pagenum" id="Page_50">[Pg 50]</span>
given, grow up, in the order of Providence, as an oak
grows out of an acorn.</p>

<p>In one thing the south has excelled,—in training
statesmen. The primary and the ultimate effects of
slavery upon this fact are so well set forth in a late
sermon by Dr. Bushnell, of Hartford, Connecticut, that
I will read a passage from it:—</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>“And here, since this institution of slavery, entering into
the fortunes of our history, complicates in so many ways the
disorders we suffer, I must pause a few moments to sketch its
characteristics. Slavery, it is not to be denied, is an essentially
barbarous institution. It gives us, too, that sign which is the
perpetual distinction of barbarism, that it has no law of progress.
The highest level it reaches is the level at which it
begins. Indeed, we need not scruple to allow that it has
yielded us one considerable advantage, in virtue of the fact
that it produces its best condition first. For while the northern
people were generally delving in labor, for many generations,
to create a condition of comfort, slavery set the masters
at once on a footing of ease, gave them leisure for elegant intercourse,
for unprofessional studies, and seasoned their character
thus with that kind of cultivation which distinguishes
men of society. A class of statesmen were thus raised up,
who were prepared to figure as leaders in scenes of public
life, where so much depends on manners and social address.
But now the scale is changing. Free labor is rising, at length,
into a state of wealth and comfort, to take the lead of American
society. Meanwhile, the foster-sons of slavery,—the
high families, the statesmen,—gradually receding in character,
as they must under this vicious institution, are receding
also in power and influence, and have been ever since the
revolution. Slavery is a condition against nature; the curse
of nature, therefore, is on it, and it bows to its doom by a law
as irresistible as gravity. It produces a condition of ease
which is not the reward of labor, and a state of degradation
which is not the curse of idleness. Therefore, the ease it
enjoys cannot but end in a curse, and the degradation it suffers
cannot rise into a blessing. It nourishes imperious and
violent passions. It makes the masters solitary sheiks on their
estates, forbidding thus the possibility of public schools, and<span class="pagenum" id="Page_51">[Pg 51]</span>
preventing also that condensed form of society which is necessary
to the vigorous maintenance of churches. Education
and religion thus displaced, the dinner table only remains, and
on this hangs, in great part, the keeping of the social state. But
however highly we may estimate the humanizing power of
hospitality, it cannot be regarded as any sufficient spring of
character. It is neither a school nor a gospel. And when it
comes of self-indulgence, or only seeks relief for the tedium
of an idle life, scarcely does it bring with it the blessings of a
virtue. The accomplishments it yields are of a mock quality,
rather than of a real, having about the same relation to a substantial
and finished culture that honor has to character. This
kind of currency will pass no longer; for, it is not expense
without comfort, or splendor set in disorder, as diamonds in
pewter; it is not air in place of elegance, or assurance substituted
for ease; neither is it to be master of a fluent speech,
or to garnish the same with stale quotations from the classics;
much less is it to live in the Don Juan vein, accepting barbarism
by poetic inspiration,—the same by which a late noble
poet, drawing out of Turks and pirates, became the chosen
laureate of slavery,—not any or all of these can make up
such a style of man, or of life, as we in this age demand.
We have come up now to a point where we look for true intellectual
refinement, and a ripe state of personal culture.
But how clearly is it seen to be a violation of its own laws, for
slavery to produce a genuine scholar, or a man who, in any
department of excellence, unless it be in politics, is not a full
century behind his time? And if we ask for what is dearer
and better still, for a pure Christian morality, the youth of
slavery are trained in no such habits as are most congenial to
virtue. The point of honor is the only principle many of
them know. Violence and dissipation bring down every succeeding
generation to a state continually lower; so that now,
after a hundred and fifty years are passed, the slaveholding
territory may be described as a vast missionary ground, and
one so uncomfortable to the faithful ministry of Christ, by
reason of its jealous tempers, and the known repugnance it
has to many of the first maxims of the gospel, that scarcely
a missionary can be found to enter it. Connected with this
moral decay, the resources of nature also are exhausted, and
her fertile territories changed to a desert, by the uncreating<span class="pagenum" id="Page_52">[Pg 52]</span>
power of a spendthrift institution. And then, having made a
waste where God had made a garden, slavery gathers up the
relics of bankruptcy, and the baser relics still of virtue and
all manly enterprise, and goes forth to renew, on a virgin
soil, its dismal and forlorn history. Thus, at length, has been
produced what may be called the bowie-knife style of civilization,
and the new west of the south is overrun by it,—a
spirit of blood which defies all laws of God and man;—honorable,
but not honest; prompt to resent an injury, slack to
discharge a debt; educated to ease, and readier, of course,
when the means of living fail, to find them at the gambling
table or the race-ground, than in any work of industry,—probably
squandering the means of living there, to relieve
the tedium of ease itself.”</p>
</div>

<p>The free schools of the north lead to the common
diffusion of knowledge, and the equalization of society.
The private schools of the south divide men into patricians
and plebeians; so that, in the latter, a nuisance
grows out of education itself. In the public schools
of New York there are libraries now amounting to
more than a million of volumes. In the schools of
Massachusetts the number of volumes is relatively
less; but the quality is greatly superior. In each of
these states, within half an hour’s walk of the poorest
farm-house or mechanic’s shop, there is a library, free
and open to every child, containing works of history,
biography, travels, ethics, natural science, &amp;c., &amp;c.,
which will supply him with the noblest capital of intelligence,
wherewith to commence the business of
making himself a useful and intelligent citizen. With
the exception of New Orleans, (whose free schools
were commenced and have been presided over by a
Massachusetts man,) and three or four other cities, all
the libraries in the public schools of the slave states
could be carried in a schoolboy’s satchel. The libraries
of all the universities and colleges of the south
contain 223,416 volumes; those of the north, 593,897
volumes. The libraries of southern theological schools,
22,800; those of northern, 102,080.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_53">[Pg 53]</span></p>

<p>Look into Silliman’s Journal, or the volumes of the
American Academy of Arts and Sciences, and inquire
whence the communications came. Where live the
historians of the country, Sparks, Prescott, Bancroft;
the poets, Whittier, Bryant, Longfellow, Lowell; the
jurists, Story, Kent, Wheaton; the classic models of
writing, Charming, Everett, Irving; the female writers,
Miss Sedgwick, Mrs. Sigourney, and Mrs. Child?
All this proceeds from no superiority of natural endowment
on the one side, or inferiority on the other. The
Southern States are all within what may be called
“the latitudes of genius;” for there is a small belt
around the globe, comprising but a few degrees of latitude,
which has produced all the distinguished men
who have ever lived. I say this difference results
from no difference in natural endowment. The mental
endowments at the south are equal to those in any
part of the world. But it comes because, in one quarter,
the common atmosphere is vivified with knowledge,
electric with ideas, while slavery gathers its
Bœotian fogs over the other. What West Point has
been to our armies in Mexico, that, and more than that,
good schools would be to the intelligence and industrial
prosperity of our country.</p>

<p>It may seem a little out of place, but I cannot forbear
here adverting to one point, which, as a lover of
children and as a parent, touches me more deeply than
any other. To whom are intrusted, at the south, the
early care and nurture of children? It has been
thought by many educators and metaphysicians, that
children learn as much before the age of seven years
as ever afterwards. Who, at the south, administers
this early knowledge,—these ideas, these views, that
have such sovereign efficacy in the formation of adult
character? Who has the custody of children during
this ductile, forming, receptive period of life,—a period
when the mind absorbs whatever is brought into<span class="pagenum" id="Page_54">[Pg 54]</span>
contact with it? Sir, the children of the south, more
or less, and generally <i>more</i>, are tended and nurtured
by slaves. Ignorance, superstition, vulgarity, passion,
and perhaps impurity, are the breasts at which they
nurse. Whatever afflictions God may see fit to bring
upon me, whatever other mercies He may withhold,
may He give me none but persons of intelligence, of
refinement, and of moral excellence, to walk with my
children during the imitative years of their existence,
and to lead them in the paths of knowledge, and
breathe into their hearts the breath of a moral and religious
life.</p>

<p>Before considering the moral character of slavery, I
wish to advert for a moment to the position which we
occupy as one of the nations of the earth, in this advancing
period of the world’s civilization. Nations, like
individuals, have a character. The date of the latter is
counted by years; that of the former, by centuries.
No man can have any self-respect, who is not solicitous
about his posthumous reputation. No man can be a
patriot who feels neither joy nor shame at the idea of
the honor or the infamy which his age and his country
shall leave behind them. Nations, like individuals,
have characteristic objects of ambition. Greece coveted
the arts; Rome gloried in war; but liberty has
been the goddess of our idolatry. Amid the storms
of freedom were we cradled; in the struggles of freedom
have our joints been knit; on the rich aliment
of freedom have we grown to our present stature.
With a somewhat too boastful spirit, perhaps, have we
challenged the admiration of the world for our devotion
to liberty; but an enthusiasm for the rights of
man is so holy a passion, that even its excesses are not
devoid of the beautiful. We have not only won freedom
for ourselves, but we have taught its sacred lessons
to others. The shout of “Death to tyrants, and
freedom for man!” which pealed through this country<span class="pagenum" id="Page_55">[Pg 55]</span>
seventy years ago, has at length reached across the
Atlantic; and whoever has given an attentive ear to
the sounds which have come back to us, within the
last few months, from the European world, cannot have
failed to perceive that they were only the far-travelled
echoes of the American Declaration of Independence.
But in the divine face of our liberty there has been
one foul, demoniac feature. Whenever her votaries
would approach her to worship, they have been fain to
draw a veil over one part of her visage, to conceal its
hideousness. Whence came this deformity on her
otherwise fair and celestial countenance? Sad is the
story, but it must be told. Her mother was a vampire.
As the daughter lay helpless in her arms, the
beldam tore open her living flesh, and feasted upon
her lifeblood. Hence this unsightly wound, that
affrights whoever beholds it. But, sir, I must leave
dallying with these ambiguous metaphors. One wants
the plain, sinewy, Saxon tongue to tell of deeds that
should have shamed devils. Great Britain was the
mother. Her American colonies were the daughter.
The mother lusted for gold. To get it, she made partnership
with robbery and death. Shackles, chains,
and weapons for human butchery, were her outfit
in trade. She made Africa her hunting-ground. She
made its people her prey, and the unwilling colonies
her market-place. She broke into the Ethiop’s home,
as a wolf into a sheepfold at midnight. She set the
continent a-flame, that she might seize the affrighted
inhabitants as they ran shrieking from their blazing
hamlets. The aged and the infant she left for the
vultures; but the strong men and the strong women
she drove, scourged and bleeding, to the shore. Packed
and stowed like merchandise between unventilated
decks, so close that the tempest without could not
ruffle the pestilential air within, the voyage was begun.
Once a day the hatches were opened, to receive food<span class="pagenum" id="Page_56">[Pg 56]</span>
and to disgorge the dead. Thousands and thousands
of corpses, which she plunged into the ocean from the
decks of her slave ships, she counted only as the tare
of commerce. The blue monsters of the deep became
familiar with her pathway, and, not more remorseless
than she, they shared her plunder. At length the accursed
vessel reached the foreign shore. And there,
monsters of the land, fiercer and feller than any that
roam the watery plains, rewarded the robber by purchasing
his spoils.</p>

<p>For more than a century did the madness of this
traffic rage. During all those years, the clock of eternity
never counted out a minute that did not witness
the cruel death, by treachery or violence, of some son
or daughter, some father or mother, of Africa. The
three millions of slaves that now darken our southern
horizon are the progeny of these progenitors,—a
doomed race, fated and suffering from sire to son. But
the enormities of the mother country did not pass
without remonstrance. Many of the colonies expostulated
against, and rebuked them. The New England
colonies, New Jersey, Pennsylvania, Virginia, presented
to the throne the most humble and suppliant
petitions, praying for the abolition of the trade. The
colonial legislatures passed laws against it. But their
petitions were spurned from the throne. Their laws
were vetoed by the governors. In informal negotiations
attempted with the ministers of the crown, the
friends of the slave were made to understand that royalty
turned an adder’s ear to their prayers. The profoundest
feelings of lamentation and abhorrence were
kindled in the bosoms of his western subjects by this
flagitious conduct of the king. In that dark catalogue
of crimes, which led our fathers to forswear allegiance
to the British throne, its refusal to prohibit the slave
trade to the colonies is made one of the most prominent
of those political offences which are said to “define<span class="pagenum" id="Page_57">[Pg 57]</span>
a tyrant.” In the original draught of the Declaration
of Independence, as prepared by Mr. Jefferson,
this crime of King George the Third is set forth in the
following words:—</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>“He has waged cruel war against human nature itself, violating
its most sacred rights of life and liberty in the persons
of a distant people who never offended him, captivating and
carrying them into slavery in another hemisphere, or to incur
a miserable death in their transportation thither. This piratical
warfare, the opprobrium of infidel powers, is the warfare
of the <span class="smcap">Christian</span> King of Great Britain. Determined to
keep a market where MEN should be bought and sold, he
has prostituted his negative for suppressing every legislative
attempt to prohibit or to restrain this execrable commerce.”</p>
</div>

<p>Now, if the King of Great Britain prostituted his
negative that slavery might not be restricted, what, in
after times, shall be said of those who prostitute their
affirmative that it may be extended? Yet it is now
proposed, in some of the state legislatures, and in this
Capitol, to do precisely the same thing, in regard to the
Territory of Oregon, which was done by Great Britain
to her transatlantic possessions; not merely to legalize
slavery there, but to prohibit its inhabitants from
prohibiting <i>it</i>. Though three thousand miles west of
Great Britain, she had certain constitutional rights over
us, and could affect our destiny. Though the inhabitants
of Oregon are three thousand miles west of us,
yet we have certain constitutional rights over them,
and can affect their destiny. Great Britain annulled
our laws for prohibiting slavery; we propose to annul
an existing law of Oregon prohibiting slavery.
If the execrations of mankind are yet too feeble and
too few to punish Great Britain for her wickedness,
what scope, what fulness, what eternity of execration
and anathema will be a sufficient retribution upon us,
if we volunteer to copy her example? It was in the
eighteenth century when the mother country thus<span class="pagenum" id="Page_58">[Pg 58]</span>
made merchandise of human beings,—a time when
liberty was a forbidden word in the languages of Europe.
It is in the nineteenth century that we propose
to reënact, and on an ampler scale, the same execrable
villany,—a time when liberty is the rallying cry of
all Christendom. So great has been the progress of
liberal ideas within the last century, that what was
venial at its beginning is unpardonable at its close.
To drive coffles of slaves from here to Oregon, in the
middle of the nineteenth century, is more infamous
than it was to bring cargoes of slaves from Africa here,
in the middle of the eighteenth. Yet such is the period
that men would select to perpetuate and increase
the horrors of this traffic.</p>

<p>Sir, how often, on this floor, have indignant remonstrances
been addressed to the north, for agitating the
subject of slavery? How often have we at the north
been told that we were inciting insurrection, fomenting
a servile war, putting the black man’s knife to the
white man’s throat. The air of this hall has been
filled, its walls have been, as it were, sculptured, by
southern eloquence, with images of devastated towns,
of murdered men and ravished women; and, as a defence
against the iniquities of the institution, they
have universally put in the plea that the calamity was
entailed upon them by the mother country, that it
made a part of the world they were born into, and
therefore they could not help it. I have always been
disposed to allow its full weight to this palliation.
But if they now insist upon perpetrating against the
whole western world, which happens at present to be
under our control, the same wrongs which, in darker
days, Great Britain perpetrated against them, they will
forfeit every claim to sympathy. Sir, here is a test.
Let not southern men, who would now force slavery
upon new regions, ever deny that their slavery at home
is a chosen, voluntary, beloved crime.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_59">[Pg 59]</span></p>

<p>But let us look, sir, at the moral character of slavery.
It is proposed not merely to continue this institution
where it now exists, but to extend it to the Pacific
Ocean,—to spread it over the vast slopes of the Rocky
Mountains. Sir, the conduct of governments, like the
conduct of individuals, is subject to the laws and the
retributions of Providence. If, therefore, there is any
ingredient of wrong in this institution, we ought not
to adopt it, or to permit it, even though it should pour
wealth in golden showers over the whole surface of
the land. In speaking of the moral character of slavery,
sir, I mean to utter no word for the purpose of
wounding the feelings of any man. On the other
hand, I mean not to wound the cause of truth by abstaining
from the utterance of any word which I ought
to speak.</p>

<p>The institution of slavery is against natural right.
Jurists, from the time of Justinian; orators, from the
time of Cicero; poets, from the time of Homer, declare
it to be wrong. The writers on moral or ethical
science,—the expounders of the law of nations and
of God,—denounce slavery as an invasion of the
rights of man. They find no warrant for it in the
eternal principles of justice and equity; and in that
great division which they set forth between right and
wrong, they arrange slavery in the catalogue of crime.
All the noblest instincts of human nature rebel against
it. Whatever has been taught by sage, or sung by
poet, in favor of freedom, is a virtual condemnation of
slavery. Whenever we applaud the great champions
of liberty, who, by the sacrifice of life in the cause of
freedom, have won the homage of the world and an
immortality of fame, we record the testimony of our
hearts against slavery. Wherever patriotism and philanthropy
have glowed brightest; wherever piety and
a devout religious sentiment have burned most fervently,
there has been the most decided recognition of
the universal rights of man.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_60">[Pg 60]</span></p>

<p>Sir, let us analyze this subject, and see if slavery be
not the most compact, and concentrated, and condensed
system of wrong which the depravity of man
has ever invented. Slavery is said to have had its origin
in war. It is claimed that the captor had a right
to take the life of his captive; and that if he spared
that life he made it his own, and thus acquired a right
to control it. I deny the right of the captor to the
life of his captive; and even if this right were conceded,
I deny his right to the life of the captive’s
offspring. But this relation between captor and captive
precludes the idea of peace; for no peace can be
made where there is no free agency. Peace being
precluded, it follows inevitably that the state of war
continues. Hence, the state of slavery is a state of
war; and though active hostilities may have ceased,
they are liable to break out, and may rightfully break
out, at any moment. How long must our fellow-citizens,
who were enslaved in Algiers, have continued in
slavery, before they would have lost the right of escape
or of resistance?</p>

<p>The gentleman from Virginia, [Mr. <span class="smcap">Bocock</span>,] in his
speech this morning, put the right of the slaveholder
upon a somewhat different ground. He said a man
might acquire property in a horse before the existence
of civil society, by catching a wild one. And so, he
added, one man might acquire property in another
man, by subduing him to his will. The superior force
gave the right, whether to the horse or to the man.
Now, if this be so, and if at any time the superior
force should change sides, then it follows inevitably
that the relation of the parties might be rightfully
changed by a new appeal to force.</p>

<p>The same gentleman claims Bible authority for slavery.
He says, “I see slavery there tolerated, I had
almost said inculcated. I see such language as this:
‘Both thy bondmen and thy bondmaids shall be of the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_61">[Pg 61]</span>
heathen that are round about you; of them shall you
buy bondmen and bondmaids; and ye shall take them
as an inheritance for your children after you, to inherit
them for a possession,’” &amp;c. Does not the gentleman
know that, by the same authority, the Israelitish slaves
were commanded to despoil their Egyptian masters,
and to escape from bondage? Surely the latter is as
good an authority as the former. If the gentleman’s
argument is sound, he is bound to advocate a repeal
of the act of 1793. If the gentleman’s argument is
sound, the free states, instead of surrendering fugitive
slaves to their masters, are bound to give those masters
a Red Sea reception and embrace; and the escape of
the children of Israel into Canaan is a direct precedent
for the underground railroad to Canada.</p>

<p>Both the gentleman from Kentucky, [Mr. <span class="smcap">French</span>,]
yesterday, and the gentleman from Virginia, to-day,
spoke repeatedly, and without the slightest discrimination,
of “a slave and a horse,” “a slave and a mule,”
&amp;c. What should we think, sir, of a teacher for our
children, or even of a tender of our cattle, who did not
recognize the difference between men and mules,—between
humanity and horse-flesh? What should we
think, if, on opening a work, claiming to be a scientific
treatise on zoölogy, we should find the author to
be ignorant of the difference between biped and quadruped,
or between men and birds, or men and fishes?
Yet such errors would be trifling compared with those
which have been made through all this debate. They
would be simple errors in natural history, perhaps
harmless; but these are errors,—fatal errors,—in humanity
and Christian ethics. No, sir; all the legislation
of the slave states proves that they do not treat,
and cannot treat, a human being as an animal. I will
show that they are ever trying to degrade him into an
animal, although they can never succeed.</p>

<p>This conscious idea that the state of slavery is a<span class="pagenum" id="Page_62">[Pg 62]</span>
state of war,—a state in which superior force keeps
inferior force down,—develops and manifests itself
perpetually. It exhibits itself in the statute books of
the slave states, prohibiting the education of slaves,
making it highly penal to teach them so much as the
alphabet; dispersing and punishing all meetings where
they come together in quest of knowledge. Look
into the statute books of the free states, and you will
find law after law, encouragement after encouragement,
to secure the diffusion of knowledge. Look into the
statute books of the slave states, and you find law
after law, penalty after penalty, to secure the extinction
of knowledge. Who has not read with delight
those books which have been written, both in England
and in this country, entitled “The Pursuit of Knowledge
under Difficulties,” giving the biographies of
illustrious men, who, by an undaunted and indomitable
spirit, had risen from poverty and obscurity to the
heights of eminence, and blessed the world with their
achievements in literature, in science, and in morals?
Yet here, in what we call republican America, are fifteen
great states, vying with each other to see which
will bring the blackest and most impervious pall of
ignorance over three millions of human beings; nay,
which can do most to stretch this pall across the continent,
from the Atlantic to the Pacific.</p>

<p>Is not knowledge a good? Is it not one of the most
precious bounties which the all-bountiful Giver has
bestowed upon the human race? Sir John Herschel,
possessed of ample wealth, his capacious mind stored
with the treasures of knowledge, surrounded by the
most learned society in the most cultivated metropolis
in the world, says, “If I were to pray for a taste
which should stand me in stead, under every variety of
circumstances, and be a source of happiness and cheerfulness
to me through life, and a shield against its ills,
however things might go amiss, and the world frown<span class="pagenum" id="Page_63">[Pg 63]</span>
upon me, it would be a taste for reading.” Yet it is
now proposed to colonize the broad regions of the
west with millions of our fellow-beings, who shall
never be able to read a book, or write a word; to
whom knowledge shall bring no delight in childhood,
no relief in the weary hours of sickness or convalescence,
no solace in the decrepitude of age; who shall
perceive nothing of the beauties of art, who shall know
nothing of the wonders of science, who shall never
reach any lofty, intellectual conception of the attributes
of their great Creator;—deaf to all the hosannas
of praise which nature sings to her Maker; blind
in this magnificent temple which God has builded.</p>

<p>Sir, it is one of the noblest attributes of man that
he can derive knowledge from his predecessors. We
possess the accumulated learning of ages. From
ten thousand confluent streams, the river of truth,
widened and deepened, has come down to us; and it
is among our choicest delights, that if we can add to
its volume, as it rolls on, it will bear a richer freight
of blessings to our successors. But it is here proposed
to annul this beneficent law of nature; to repel this
proffered bounty of Heaven. It is proposed to create
a race of men, to whom all the lights of experience
shall be extinguished; whose hundredth generation
shall be as ignorant and as barbarous as its first.</p>

<p>Sir, I hold all voluntary ignorance to be a crime; I
hold all enforced ignorance to be a greater crime.
Knowledge is essential to all rational enjoyment; it is
essential to the full and adequate performance of every
duty. Whoever intercepts knowledge, therefore, on
its passage to a human soul; whoever strikes down
the hand that is outstretched to grasp it, is guilty of
one of the most heinous of offences. Add to your
virtue knowledge, says the apostle; but here the command
is, Be-cloud and be-little by ignorance whatever
virtue you may possess.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_64">[Pg 64]</span></p>

<p>Sir, let me justify the earnestness of these expressions
by describing the transition of feeling through
which I have lately passed. I come from a community
where knowledge ranks next to virtue in the classification
of blessings. On the tenth day of April last,
the day before I left home for this place, I attended
the dedication of a schoolhouse in Boston which had
cost $70,000. The mayor presided, and much of the
intelligence and worth of the city was present on the
occasion. I see by a paper which I have this day received,
that another schoolhouse, in the same city, was
dedicated on Monday of the present week. It was
there stated by the mayor that the cost of the city
schoolhouses which had been completed within the
last three months was $200,000. On Tuesday of
this week, a new high schoolhouse in the city of Cambridge
was dedicated. Mr. Everett, the president of
Harvard College, was present, and addressed the assembly
in a long, and, I need not add, a most beautiful
speech. That schoolhouse, with two others to be
dedicated within a week, will have cost $25,000.
Last week, in the neighboring city of Charlestown, a
new high schoolhouse, of a most splendid and costly
character, was dedicated by the mayor and city government,
by clergy and laity. But it is not mayors
of cities and presidents of colleges alone that engage
in the work of consecrating temples of education to
the service of the young. Since I have been here,
the governor of the commonwealth, Mr. Briggs, went
to Newburyport, a distance of forty miles, to attend
the dedication of a schoolhouse which cost $25,000.
On a late occasion, when the same excellent chief
magistrate travelled forty miles to attend the dedication
of a schoolhouse in the country, some speaker
congratulated the audience because the governor of
the commonwealth had come down from the executive
chair to honor the occasion. “No,” said he, “I have<span class="pagenum" id="Page_65">[Pg 65]</span>
come up to the occasion to be honored by it.” Within
the last year, $200,000 have been given by individuals
to Harvard College. Within a little longer time
than this, the other two colleges in the state have received,
together, a still larger endowment from individuals
or the state.</p>

<p>These measures are part of a great system which
we are carrying on for the elevation of the race. Last
year, the voters of Massachusetts, in their respective
towns, voluntarily taxed themselves about a million
of dollars for the support of Common Schools. We
have an old law on the statute book, requiring towns
to tax themselves for the support of public schools;
but the people have long since lost sight of this
law in the munificence of their contributions. Massachusetts
is now erecting a reform school for vagrant
and exposed children,—so many of whom come to
us from abroad,—which will cost the state more than
a hundred thousand dollars. An unknown individual
has given twenty thousand dollars towards it. We
educate all our deaf and dumb and blind. An appropriation
was made by the last legislature to establish a
school for idiots, in imitation of those beautiful institutions
in Paris, in Switzerland, and in Berlin, where
the most revolting and malicious of this deplorable
class are tamed into docility, made lovers of order and
neatness, and capable of performing many valuable
services. The future teacher of this school is now
abroad, preparing himself for his work. A few years
ago, Mr. Everett, the present president of Harvard
College, then governor of the commonwealth, spoke
the deep <i>convictions</i> of Massachusetts people, when, in
a public address on education, he exhorted the fathers
and mothers of Massachusetts in the following words:
“Save,” said he, “save, spare, scrape, stint, starve, do
any thing but steal,” to educate your children. And
Doctor Howe, the noble-hearted director of the Institution<span class="pagenum" id="Page_66">[Pg 66]</span>
for the Blind, lately uttered the deepest <i>sentiments</i>
of our citizens, when, in speaking of our duties
to the blind, the deaf and dumb, and the idiotic, he
said, “The sight of any human being left to brutish
ignorance is always demoralizing to the beholders.
There floats not upon the stream of life a wreck of
humanity so utterly shattered and crippled, but that
its signals of distress should challenge attention and
command assistance.”</p>

<p>Sir, it was all glowing and fervid with sentiments
like these, that, a few weeks ago, I entered this House,—sentiments
transfused into my soul from without,
even if I had no vital spark of nobleness to kindle
them within. Imagine, then, my strong revulsion of
feeling, when the first set, elaborate speech which I
heard, was that of the gentleman from Virginia, proposing
to extend ignorance to the uttermost bounds of
this republic,—to legalize it, to enforce it, to necessitate
it, and make it eternal. Since him, many others
have advocated the same abhorrent doctrine. Not satisfied
with dooming a whole race of our fellow-beings
to mental darkness, impervious and everlasting,—not
satisfied with drawing this black curtain of ignorance
between man and nature, between the human soul and
its God, from the Atlantic to the Rio Grande, across
half the continent,—they desire to increase this race
ten, twenty millions more, and to unfold and spread
out this black curtain across the other half of the continent.
When, sir, in the halls of legislation, men
advocate measures like this, it is no figure of speech
to say that their words are the clankings of multitudinous
fetters; each gesture of their arms tears human
flesh with ten thousand whips; each exhalation of
their breath spreads clouds of moral darkness from
horizon to horizon.</p>

<p>Twenty years ago, a sharp sensation ran through the
nerves of the civilized world, at the story of a young<span class="pagenum" id="Page_67">[Pg 67]</span>
man named Caspar Hauser, found in the city of Nuremberg,
in Bavaria. Though sixteen or seventeen years
of age, he could not walk nor talk. He heard without
understanding; he saw without perceiving; he moved
without definite purpose. It was the soul of an infant
in the body of an adult. After he had learned to
speak, he related that, from his earliest recollection,
he had always been kept in a hole so small, that he
could not stretch out his limbs, where he saw no
light, heard no sound, nor even witnessed the face of
the attendant who brought him his scanty food. For
many years conjecture was rife concerning his history,
and all Germany was searched to discover his origin.
After a long period of fruitless inquiry and speculation,
public opinion settled down into the belief that
he was the victim of some great unnatural crime;
that he was the heir to some throne, and had been
sequestered by ambition; or the inheritor of vast
wealth, and had been hidden away by cupidity; or
the offspring of criminal indulgence, and had been
buried alive to avoid exposure and shame. A German,
Von Feuerbach, published an account of Caspar, entitled
“The Example of a Crime on the Life of the
Soul.” But why go to Europe to be thrilled with the
pathos of a human being shrouded from the light of
nature, and cut off from a knowledge of duty and of
God? To-day, in this boasted land of light and liberty,
there are three million Caspar Hausers; and, as
if this were not enough, it is proposed to multiply
their number tenfold, and to fill up all the western
world with these proofs of human avarice and guilt.
It is proposed that we ourselves should create and
should publish to the world, not one, but untold millions
of “Examples of <i>a Crime on the Life of the
Soul</i>.” It is proposed that the self-styled freemen, the
self-styled Christians, of fifteen great states in this
American Union, shall engage in the work of procreating,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_68">[Pg 68]</span>
rearing, and <i>selling</i> Caspar Hausers, often from
their own loins; and if any further development of
soul or of body is allowed to the American victims
than was permitted to the Bavarian child, it is only
because such development will increase their market
value at the barracoons. It is not from any difference
of motive, but only the better to insure that motive’s
indulgence. The slave child must be allowed to use
his limbs, or how could he drudge out his life in the
service of his master? The slave infant must be
taught to walk, or how, <i>under the shadow of this
thrice-glorious Capitol</i>, could he join a coffle for New
Orleans?</p>

<p>I know, sir, that it has been said, within a short time
past, that Caspar Hauser was an impostor, and his story
a fiction. Would to God that this could ever be said
of his fellow-victims in America!</p>

<p>For another reason slavery is an unspeakable wrong.
The slave is debarred from testifying against a white
man. The courts will not hear him as a witness. By
the principles of the common law, if any man suffers
violence at the hands of another, he can prefer his
complaint to magistrates, or to the grand juries of the
courts, who are bound to give him redress. Hence
the law is said to hold up its shield before every man
for his protection. It surrounds him in the crowded
street and in the solitary place. It guards his treasures
with greater vigilance than locks or iron safes;
and against meditated aggressions upon himself, his
wife, or his children, it fastens his doors every night
more securely than triple bolts of brass. But all these
sacred protections are denied to the slave. While subjected
to the law of force, he is shut out from the law
of right. To suffer injury is his, but never to obtain
redress. For personal cruelties, for stripes that shiver
his flesh, and blows that break his bones, for robbery
or for murder, neither he nor his friends can have preventive,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_69">[Pg 69]</span>
remedy, or recompense. The father, who is
a slave, may see son or daughter scored, mangled, mutilated,
or ravished before his eyes, and he must be
dumb as a sheep before its shearers. The wife may
be dishonored in the presence of the husband, and, if
he remonstrates or rebels, the miscreant who could burn
with the lust will burn not less fiercely with a vengeance
to be glutted upon his foiler.</p>

<p>Suppose, suddenly, by some disastrous change in
the order of nature, an entire kingdom or community
were to be enveloped in total darkness,—to have no
day, no dawn, but midnight evermore! Into what
infinite forms of violence and wrong would the depraved
passions of the human heart spring up, when
no longer restrained by the light of day, and the dangers
of exposure! So far as legal rights against his
oppressors are concerned, the slave lives in such a
world of darkness. A hundred of his fellows may
stand around him and witness the wrongs he suffers,
but not one of them can appeal to jury, magistrate, or
judge, for punishment or redress. The wickedest
white man, in a company of slaves, bears a charmed
life. There is not one of the fell passions that rages
in his bosom which he cannot indulge with wantonness
and to satiety, and the court has no ears to hear
the complaint of the victim. How dearly does every
honorable man prize character! The law denies the
slave a character; for, however traduced, legal vindication
is impossible.</p>

<p>And yet, infinitely flagrant as the anomaly is, the
slave is amenable to the laws of the land for all offences
which he may commit against others, though
he is powerless to protect himself by the same law
from offences which others may commit against him.
He may suffer all wrong, and the courts will not
hearken to his testimony; but for the first wrong he
does, the same courts inflict their severest punishments<span class="pagenum" id="Page_70">[Pg 70]</span>
upon him. This is the reciprocity of slave law.—to
be forever liable to be proved guilty, but never able to
prove himself innocent; to be subject to all punishments,
but, through his own oath, to no protection.
Hear what is said by the highest judicial tribunal
of South Carolina: “Although slaves are held to be
the absolute property of their owners, yet they have
the power of committing crimes.”—<i>2d Nott and
McCord’s Rep.</i>, p. 179. A negro is so far amenable
to the common law, that he may be one of three to
constitute the number necessary to make a riot.—<i>1st
Bay’s Rep.</i>, 358. By the laws of the same state, a
negro may be himself stolen, and he has no redress;
but if he steals a negro from another, he shall be hung.—<i>2d
Nott and McCord’s Rep.</i>, 179. [<i>An example
of this penalty suffered by a slave.</i>] This is the way
that slave legislatures and slave judicatories construe
the command of Christ, “Whatsoever ye would that
men should do unto you, do ye also the same unto
them.” Nay, by the laws of some of the slave states,
where master and slave are engaged in a joint act, the
slave is indictable, while the master is not.</p>

<p>What rights are more sacred or more dear to us than
the conjugal and the parental? No savage nation,
however far removed from the frontiers of civilization,
has ever yet been discovered, where these rights were
unknown or unhonored. The beasts of the forest feel
and respect them. It is only in the land of slaves that
they are blotted out and annihilated.</p>

<p>Slavery is an unspeakable wrong to the conscience.
The word “conscience” conveys a complex idea. It
includes conscientiousness; that is, the sentiment or
instinct of right and wrong; and also intelligence,
which is the guide of this sentiment. <i>Conscience</i>,
then, implies both the desire or impulse to do right, and
also a knowledge of what is right. Nature endows us
with the sentiment, but the knowledge we must acquire.<span class="pagenum" id="Page_71">[Pg 71]</span>
Hence we speak of an “enlightened conscience,”
meaning thereby not only the moral sense, but
that knowledge of circumstances, relations, tendencies
and results, which is necessary in order to guide the
moral sense to just conclusions. Each of these elements
is equally necessary to enable a man to feel rightly and
to act rightly. Mere knowledge, without the moral
sense, can take no cognizance of the everlasting distinctions
between right and wrong; and so the blind
instinct, unguided by knowledge, will be forever at
fault in its conclusions. The two were made to coëxist
and operate together by Him who made the human
soul. But the impious hand of man divorces these
twin capacities, wherever it denies knowledge. If one
of these coördinate powers in the mental realm be annulled
by the legislature, it may be called <i>law</i>; but it
is repugnant to every law and attribute of God.</p>

<p>But, not satisfied with having invaded the human
soul, and annihilated one of its most sacred attributes,
in the persons of three millions of our fellow-men; not
satisfied with having killed the conscience, as far as it
can be killed by human device, and human force, in
an entire race; we are now invoked to multiply that
race, to extend it over regions yet unscathed by its existence,
and there to call into being other millions of
men, upon whose souls, and upon the souls of whose
posterity, the same unholy spoliation shall be committed
forever.</p>

<p>Slavery is an unspeakable wrong to the religious
nature of man. The dearest and most precious of all
human rights is the right of private judgment in matters
of religion. I am interested in nothing else so
much as in the attributes of my Creator, and in the
relations which he has established between me and
himself, for time and for eternity. To investigate
for myself these relations, and their momentous consequences;
to “search the Scriptures;” to explore the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_72">[Pg 72]</span>
works of God in the outward and visible universe; to
ask counsel of the sages and divines of the ages gone
by,—these are rights which it would be sacrilege in
me to surrender; which it is a worse sacrilege in any
human being or human government to usurp. Yet, by
denying education to the slave, you destroy not merely
the <i>right</i>, but the <i>power</i>, of personal examination in
regard to all that most nearly concerns the soul’s interests.
Who so base as not to reverence the mighty
champions of religious freedom, in days when the
dungeon, the rack, and the fagot were the arguments
of a government theology? Who does not reverence,
I say, Wickliffe, Huss, Luther, and the whole army of
martyrs whose blood reddened the axe of English intolerance?
Yet it was only for this right of private
judgment, for this independence of another man’s
control in religious concernments, that the godlike
champions of religious liberty perilled themselves and
perished. Yet it is this very religious despotism over
millions of men which it is now proposed, not to
destroy, but to create. It is proposed not to break old
fetters and cast them away, but to forge new ones and
rivet them on. Sir, on the continent of Europe, and
in the Tower of London, I have seen the axes, the
chains, and other horrid implements of death, by which
the great defenders of freedom for the soul were
brought to their final doom,—by which political and
religious liberty was cloven down; but fairer and
lovelier to the view were axe and chain, and all the
ghastly implements of death ever invented by religious
bigotry or civil despotism to wring and torture freedom
out of the soul of man;—fairer and lovelier were they
all than the parchment roll of this House on which
shall be inscribed a law for profaning one additional
foot of American soil with the curse of slavery.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_73">[Pg 73]</span></p>

<p>After the above speech was delivered, I was referred
to a Tract, written by a Virginian, on the subject of
slavery; and, by the politeness of its author, I have
since obtained a copy of it. It is entitled, “<i>Address
to the People of West Virginia; showing that Slavery
is injurious to the public welfare, and that it may be
gradually abolished, without detriment to the rights
and interests of Slaveholders.</i> <span class="smcap">By a Slaveholder of
West Virginia.</span> Lexington: R. C. Noel. 1847.” This
Address was written by the Rev. Henry Ruffner, D. D.,
president of Lexington College, Lexington, Va. Some
of the passages of this Address are so striking; it is
throughout so corroborative of one of the arguments
contained in the speech; and coming, as it does, from
a Virginian, an eye-witness of the effects of slavery,
and a holder of slaves, that I have thought it would be
useful to append them. The extracts, of course, are not,
as here, consecutive.</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>Nowhere, since time began, have the two systems of
slave labor and free labor been subjected to so fair and so decisive
a trial of their effects on public prosperity as in these
United States. Here the two systems have worked side by
side for ages, under such equal circumstances, both political
and physical, and with such ample time and opportunity for
each to work out its proper effects, that all must admit the experiment
to be now complete, and the result decisive. No
man of common sense, who has observed this result, can
doubt for a moment that the system of free labor promotes
the growth and prosperity of states in a much higher degree
than the system of slave labor. In the first settlement of a
country, when labor is scarce and dear, slavery may give a
temporary impulse to improvement; but even this is not the
case, except in warm climates, and where free men are scarce
and either sickly or lazy; and when we have said this, we<span class="pagenum" id="Page_74">[Pg 74]</span>
have said all that experience in the United States warrants us
to say, in favor of the policy of employing slave labor.</p>

<p>It is the common remark of all who have travelled through
the United States, that the free states and the slave states
exhibit a striking contrast in their appearance. In the older
free states are seen all the tokens of prosperity;—a dense
and increasing population; thriving villages, towns, and cities;
a neat and productive agriculture, growing manufactures, and
active commerce.</p>

<p>In the older parts of the slave states,—with a few local
exceptions,—are seen, on the contrary, too evident signs of
stagnation, or of positive decay;—a sparse population, a
slovenly cultivation spread over vast fields that are wearing out,
among others already worn out and desolate; villages and towns,
“few and far between,” rarely growing, often decaying, sometimes
mere remnants of what they were, sometimes deserted
ruins, haunted only by owls; generally no manufactures, nor
even trades, except the indispensable few; commerce and
navigation abandoned, as far as possible, to the people of the
free states; and generally, instead of the stir and bustle of
industry, a dull and dreamy stillness, broken, if broke at all,
only by the wordy brawl of politics.</p>

<p>New England and the middle states of New York, New
Jersey, and Pennsylvania contained, in 1790, 1,968,000 inhabitants,
and in 1840, 6,760,000; having gained, in this period,
243 per cent.</p>

<p>The four old slave states had, in 1790, a population of
1,473,000, and in 1840, of 3,279,000; having gained, in the
same period, 122 per cent., just about half as much, in proportion,
as the free states. They ought to have gained about
twice as much; for they had at first only seven inhabitants to
the square mile, when the free states not only had upwards of
twelve, but, on the whole, much inferior advantages of soil and
climate. Even cold, barren New England, though more than
twice as thickly peopled, grew in population at a faster rate
than these old slave states.</p>

<p>About half the territory of these old slave states is new
country, and has comparatively few slaves. On this part the
increase of population has chiefly taken place. On the old
slave-labored lowlands, a singular phenomena has appeared;<span class="pagenum" id="Page_75">[Pg 75]</span>
there, within the bounds of these rapidly growing United
States,—yes, there, population has been long at a stand;
yes, over wide regions,—especially in Virginia,—it has declined,
and a new wilderness is gaining upon the cultivated
land! What has done this work of desolation? Not war,
nor pestilence; not oppression of rulers, civil or ecclesiastical;
but <i>slavery</i>, a curse more destructive in its effects than
any of them. It were hard to find, in old king-ridden, priest-ridden,
overtaxed Europe, so large a country, where, within
twenty years past, such a growing poverty and desolation have
appeared.</p>

<p>It is in the last period of ten years, from 1830 to 1840, that
this consuming plague of slavery has shown its worst effects
in the old Southern States. Including the increase in their
newly-settled and western counties, they gained in population
only 7¹⁄₂ per cent.; while cold, barren, thickly peopled New
England gained 15, and the old Middle States 26 per cent.
East Virginia actually fell off 26,000 in population; and,
with the exception of Richmond and one or two other towns,
her population continues to decline. Old Virginia was the
first to sow this land of ours with slavery; she is also the first
to reap the full harvest of destruction. Her lowland neighbors
of Maryland and the Carolinas were not far behind at
the <i>seeding</i>; nor are they far behind at the ingathering of
desolation.</p>

<p>Let us take the rich and beautiful State of Kentucky, compared
with her free neighbor Ohio. The slaves of Kentucky
have composed less than a fourth part of her population. But
mark their effect upon the comparative growth of the state.
In the year 1800, Kentucky contained 221,000 inhabitants,
and Ohio, 45,000. In forty years, the population of Kentucky
had risen to 780,000; that of Ohio to 1,519,000. This wonderful
difference could not be owing to any natural superiority
of the Ohio country. Kentucky is nearly as large, nearly as
fertile, and quite equal, in other gifts of nature. She had
greatly the advantage, too, in the outset of this forty years’
race of population. She started with 5¹⁄₂ inhabitants to the
square mile, and came out with 20: Ohio started with one inhabitant
to the square mile, and came out with 38. Kentucky
had full possession of her territory at the beginning. Much
of Ohio was then, and for a long time afterwards, in possession<span class="pagenum" id="Page_76">[Pg 76]</span>
of the Indians. Ohio is by this time considerably more
than twice as thickly peopled as Kentucky; yet she still gains,
both by natural increase and by the influx of emigrants;
while Kentucky has for twenty years been receiving much
fewer emigrants than Ohio, and multitudes of her citizens have
been yearly moving off to newer and yet newer countries.</p>

<p>Compare this natural increase with the census returns, and
it appears that, in the ten years from 1830 to 1840, Virginia
lost by emigration no fewer than 375,000 of her people, of
whom East Virginia lost 304,000, and West Virginia 71,000.
At this rate Virginia supplies the west every ten years with a
population equal in number to the population of the State of
Mississippi in 1840!</p>

<p>Some Virginia politicians, proudly,—yes, <i>proudly</i>, fellow-citizens,—call
our old commonwealth <i>The Mother of States</i>!
These <i>enlightened</i> patriots might pay her a still higher compliment,
by calling her <i>The Grandmother</i> of States. For our
part, we are grieved and mortified to think of the lean and
haggard condition of our venerable mother. Her black children
have sucked her so dry, that now, for a long time past,
she has not milk enough for her offspring, either black or
white.</p>

<p>She has sent,—or we should rather say, she has driven,—from
her soil at least one third of all the emigrants who have
gone from the old states to the new. More than another third
have gone from the other old slave states. Many of these
multitudes, who have left the slave states, have shunned the
regions of slavery, and settled in the free countries of the
west. These were generally industrious and enterprising
white men, who found, by sad experience, that a country of
slaves was not the country for them. It is a truth, a certain
truth, that <i>slavery drives free laborers,—farmers, mechanics,
and all, and some of the best of them too,—out of the country,
and fills their places with negroes</i>.</p>

<p>It is admitted on all hands, that slave labor is better adapted
to agriculture than to any other branch of industry; and that,
if not good for agriculture, it is really good for nothing.</p>

<p>Therefore, since in agriculture slave labor is proved to be
far less productive than free labor, <i>slavery is demonstrated
to be not only unprofitable, but deeply injurious to the public
prosperity</i>.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_77">[Pg 77]</span></p>

<p>We do not mean that slave labor can never earn any thing
for him that employs it. The question is between free labor
and slave labor. He that chooses to employ a sort of labor
that yields only half as much to the hand as another sort
would yield, makes a choice that is not only unprofitable, but
deeply injurious to his interest.</p>

<p>Agriculture in the slave states may be characterized in
general by two epithets, <i>extensive</i>, <i>exhaustive</i>,—which in all
agricultural countries forebode two things, <i>impoverishment</i>,
<i>depopulation</i>. The general system of slaveholding farmers
and planters, in all times and places, has been, and now is,
and ever will be, to cultivate much land, badly, for present
gain,—in short, to kill the goose that lays the golden egg.
They cannot do otherwise with laborers who work by compulsion,
for the benefit only of their masters, and whose sole interest
in the matter is to do as little and to consume as much
as possible.</p>

<p>This ruinous system of large farms cultivated by slaves
showed its effects in Italy, eighteen hundred years ago, when
the Roman empire was at the height of its grandeur.</p>

<p>Pliny, a writer of that age, in his Natural History, (Book
18, c. 1-7,) tells us, that while the small farms of former
times were cultivated by freemen, and even great commanders
did not disdain to labor with their own hands, agriculture
flourished, and provisions were abundant; but that afterwards,
when the lands were engrossed by a few great proprietors,
and cultivated by fettered and branded slaves, the country
was ruined, and corn had to be imported. The same system
was spreading ruin over the provinces, and thus the prosperity
of the empire was undermined. Pliny denounces, as the
worst of all, the system of having large estates in the country
cultivated by slaves, or indeed, says he, “<i>to have any thing
done by men who labor without hope of reward</i>.”</p>

<p>So Livy, the great Roman historian, observed, some years
before Pliny, (Book 6, c. 12,) that “innumerable multitudes
of men formerly inhabited those parts of Italy, where, in his
time, none but slaves redeemed the country from desertion;”—that
is, a dense population of free laborers had been succeeded
by a sparse population of slaves.</p>

<p>Even the common mechanical trades do not flourish in a
slave state. Some mechanical operations must, indeed, be<span class="pagenum" id="Page_78">[Pg 78]</span>
performed in every civilized country; but the general rule in
the south is, to import from abroad every fabricated thing that
can be carried in ships, such as household furniture, boats,
boards, laths, carts, ploughs, axes, and axehelves, besides innumerable
other things, which free communities are accustomed
to make for themselves. What is most wonderful is,
that the forests and iron mines of the south supply, in great
part, the materials out of which these things are made. The
northern freemen come with their ships, carry home the timber
and pig iron, work them up, supply their own wants with
a part, and then sell the rest at a good profit in the southern
markets. Now, although mechanics, by setting up their shops
in the south, could save all these freights and profits, yet so
it is, that northern mechanics will not settle in the south, and
the southern mechanics are undersold by their northern competitors.</p>

<p>Now connect with these wonderful facts another fact, and
the mystery is solved. The number of mechanics, in different
parts of the south, is in the inverse ratio of the number
of slaves; or in other words, where the slaves form the largest
proportion of the inhabitants, there the mechanics and manufacturers
form the least. In those parts only where the slaves
are comparatively few, are many mechanics and artificers to
be found; but even in these parts they do not flourish as the
same useful class of men flourish in the free states. Even
in our Valley of Virginia, remote from the sea, many of our
mechanics can hardly stand against northern competition.
This can be attributed only to slavery, which paralyzes our
energies, disperses our population, and keeps us few and poor,
in spite of the bountiful gifts of nature with which a benign
Providence has endowed our country.</p>

<p>Of all the states in this Union, not one has on the whole
such various and abundant resources for manufacturing as
our own Virginia, both East and West. Only think of her
vast forests of timber, her mountains of iron, her regions of
stone coal, her valleys of limestone and marble, her fountains
of salt, her immense sheep-walks for wool, her vicinity to the
cotton fields, her innumerable waterfalls, her bays, harbors,
and rivers for circulating products on every side;—in short,
every material and every convenience necessary for manufacturing
industry.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_79">[Pg 79]</span></p>

<p>Above all, think of Richmond, nature’s chosen site for the
greatest manufacturing city in America,—her beds of coal
and iron, just at hand, her incomparable water power, her
tide-water navigation, conducting sea vessels from the foot of
her falls, and above them her fine canal to the mountains,
through which lie the shortest routes from the eastern tides to
the great rivers of the west and the south-west. Think, also,
that this Richmond, in old Virginia, “the mother of states,”
has enjoyed these unparalleled advantages ever since the
United States became a nation;—and then think again, that
this same Richmond, the metropolis of all Virginia, has fewer
manufactures than a third-rate New England town;—fewer,—not
than the new city of Lowell, which is beyond all comparison,—but
fewer than the obscure place called Fall River,
among the barren hills of Massachusetts;—and then, fellow-citizens,
what will you think,—what <i>must</i> you think,—of the
cause of this strange phenomenon? Or, to enlarge the scope
of the question: What must you think has caused Virginians in
general to neglect their superlative advantages for manufacturing
industry?—to disregard the evident suggestions of
nature, pointing out to them this fruitful source of population,
wealth, and comfort?</p>

<p>Say not that this state of things is chargeable to the <i>apathy</i>
of Virginians. That is nothing to the purpose, for it does not
go to the bottom of the subject. What causes the apathy?
That is the question.</p>

<p>The last census gave also the cost of constructing new
buildings in each state, exclusive of the value of the materials.
The amount of this is a good test of the increase of wealth
in a country. To compare different states in this particular,
we must divide the total cost of building by the number of
inhabitants, and see what the average will be for each inhabitant.
We find that it is in Massachusetts, $3·60; in Connecticut,
$3·50; in New York, $3·00; in New Jersey, $2·70;
in Pennsylvania, $3·10; in Maryland, $2·30; and in Virginia,
$1·10.</p>

<p>No state has greater conveniences for ship navigation and
ship building than Virginia. Yet on all her fine tide waters
she has little shipping; and what she has is composed almost
wholly of small bay craft and a few coasting schooners.</p>

<p>We do not blame our southern people for abstaining from<span class="pagenum" id="Page_80">[Pg 80]</span>
all employments of this kind. What could they do? Set
their negroes to building ships? Who ever imagined such
an absurdity? But could they not hire white men to do such
things? No; for, in the first place, southern white men have
no skill in such matters; and, in the second place, northern
workmen cannot be hired in the south, without receiving a
heavy premium for working in a slave state.</p>

<p>The boast of our West Virginia is the good city of Wheeling.
Would that she was six times as large, that she might
equal Pittsburg, and that she grew five times as fast, that she
might keep up with her!</p>

<p>We glory in Wheeling, because she only, in Virginia, deserves
to be called a manufacturing town. For this her citizens
deserve to be crowned,—not with laurel,—but with the
solid gold of prosperity. But how came it that Wheeling,
and next to her, Wellsburg,—of all the towns in Virginia,—should
become manufacturing towns? Answer: They
breathe the atmosphere of free states, almost touching them
on both sides. But again; seeing that Wheeling, as a seat
for manufactures, is equal to Pittsburg, and inferior to no town
in America, except Richmond; and that, moreover, she has
almost no slaves; why is Wheeling so far behind Pittsburg,
and comparatively so slow in her growth? Answer: She is
in a country in which slavery is established by law.</p>

<p>We shall explain, by examples, how a few slaves in a country
may do its citizens more immediate injury than a large
number.</p>

<p>When a white family own fifty or one hundred slaves, they
can, so long as their land produces well, afford to be indolent
and expensive in their habits; for though each yields only a
small profit, yet each member of the family has ten or fifteen
of these black work-animals to toil for his support. It is not
until the fields grow old, and the crops grow short, and the
negroes and the overseer take nearly all, that the day of ruin
can be no longer postponed. If the family be not <i>very</i> indolent
and <i>very</i> expensive, this inevitable day may not come before
the third generation. But the ruin of small slaveholders
is often accomplished in a single lifetime.</p>

<p>When a white family own five or ten slaves, they cannot
afford to be indolent and expensive in their habits; for one
black drudge cannot support one white gentleman or lady.<span class="pagenum" id="Page_81">[Pg 81]</span>
Yet, because they are slaveholders, this family will feel some
aspirations for a life of easy gentility; and because field work
and kitchen work are negroes’ work, the young gentlemen
will dislike to go with the negroes to dirty field work, and the
young ladies will dislike to join the black sluts in any sort of
household labor. Such unthrifty sentiments are the natural
consequence of introducing slaves among the families of a
country, especially negro slaves. They infallibly grow and
spread, creating among the white families a distaste for all
servile labor, and a desire to procure slaves who may take all
drudgery off their hands. Thus general industry gives way
by degrees to indolent relaxation, false notions of dignity and
refinement, and a taste for fashionable luxuries. Then debts
slyly accumulate. The result is, that many families are compelled
by their embarrassments to sell off and leave the
country. Many who are unable to buy slaves leave it also,
because they feel degraded, and cannot prosper, where slavery
exists. Citizens of the valley! is it not so? Is not this
the chief reason why your beautiful country does not prosper
like the northern valleys?</p>

<p>We have examined the census of counties for the last
thirty or forty years, in Maryland, Virginia, and North Carolina,
with the view to discover the law of population in the
northern slave states. The following are among the general
results:—</p>

<p>When a county had at first comparatively few slaves, the
slave population, except near the free borders, gained upon
the whites, and most rapidly in the older parts of the
country.</p>

<p>The population, as a whole, increased so long as the slaves
were fewer than the whites, but more slowly as the numbers
approached to equality. In our valley, a smaller proportion
of slaves had the effect of a larger one in East Virginia, to
retard the increase of population.</p>

<p>When the slaves became as numerous as the whites in the
eastern and older parts of the country, population came to a
stand; when they outnumbered the whites, it declined. Consequently,
the slave population has tended to diffuse itself
equally over the country, rising more rapidly as it was further
below the white population, and going down when it had
risen above them.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_82">[Pg 82]</span></p>

<p>The price of cotton has regulated the price of negroes in
Virginia; and so it must continue to do; because slave labor
is unprofitable here, and nothing keeps up the price of slaves
but their value as a marketable commodity in the south.
Eastern negroes and western cattle are alike in this, that, if
the market abroad go down or be closed, both sorts of animals,
the horned and the woolly-headed, become a worthless
drug at home. The fact is, that our eastern brethren must
send off, on any terms, the increase of their slaves, because
their impoverished country cannot sustain even its present
stock of negroes. We join not the English and American
abolition cry about “slave-breeding” in East Virginia, as if it
were a chosen occupation, and therefore a reproachful one.
It is no such thing, but a case of dire necessity, and many a
heartache does it cost the good people there. But behold in
the east the doleful consequences of letting slavery grow up
to an oppressive and heart-sickening burden upon a community!
Cast it off, West Virginians, whilst yet you have the
power; for if you let it descend unbroken to your children,
it will have grown to a mountain of misery upon their heads.</p>

<p>Good policy will require the Southern States, ere long, to
close their markets against northern negroes. When the
southern slave market is closed, or when, by the reduced profits
of slave labor in the south, it becomes glutted,—then the
stream of Virginia negroes, heretofore pouring down upon
the south, will be thrown back upon the state, and, like a
river dammed up, must spread itself over the whole territory
of the commonwealth. The head spring in East Virginia
cannot contain itself; it must find vent; it will shed its black
streams through every gap of the Blue Ridge and pour over
the Alleghany, till it is checked by abolitionism on the borders.
But even abolitionism cannot finally stop it. Abolitionism
itself will tolerate slavery, when slaveholders grow
sick and tired of it.</p>

<p>In plain terms, fellow-citizens, eastern slaveholders will
come with their multitudes of slaves to settle upon the fresh
lands of West Virginia. Eastern slaves will be sent by thousands
for a market in West Virginia. Every valley will
echo with the cry, “Negroes! Negroes for sale! Dog
cheap! Dog cheap!” And because they are dog cheap,
many of our people will buy them. We have shown how<span class="pagenum" id="Page_83">[Pg 83]</span>
slavery has prepared the people for this; how a little slavery
makes way for more, and how the law of slave increase operates
to fill up every part of the country to the same level
with slaves.</p>

<p>And then, fellow-citizens, when you have suffered your
country to be filled with negro slaves instead of white freemen;
when its population shall be as motley as Joseph’s coat
of many colors; as ring-streaked and speckled as father
Jacob’s flock was in Padan Aram,—what will the white basis
of representation avail you, if you obtain it? Whether you
obtain it or not, East Virginia will have triumphed; or, rather,
<i>slavery</i> will have triumphed, and all Virginia will have become
a land of darkness and of the shadow of death.</p>

<p>Then, by a forbearance which has no merit, and a supineness
which has no excuse, you will have given to your children,
for their inheritance, this lovely land blackened with a
negro population,—the offscourings of Eastern Virginia,
the fag-end of slavery, the loathsome dregs of that cup of
abomination which has already sickened to death the eastern
half of our commonwealth.</p>

<p>Delay, not, then, we beseech you, to raise a barrier against
this Stygian inundation, to stand at the Blue Ridge, and
with sovereign energy say to this Black Sea of misery,
“Hitherto shalt thou come, and no farther.”</p>

Missouri compromise, had not surrendered its right to carry slavery
north of the compromise line? His question was not understood. If
it had been, it would have been replied, that the existence of slavery
at New Orleans, and a few other places in Louisiana, at the time of
the treaty with France, by no means established the right to carry it
to the Pacific Ocean, if the treaty extended so far. Slavery being
against natural right, can only exist by virtue of positive law, backed
by force sufficient to protect it. It could not lawfully exist, therefore,
in any part of Louisiana, which had not been laid out, organized, and
subjected to the civil jurisdiction of the government. Such was not
the case with any part of the territory north of the compromise line,
and therefore nothing was surrendered. On the other hand, in the
formation of the territorial governments of Orleans, Missouri, Arkansas, and Florida, a vast extent of country was surrendered to slavery.
And this is independent of the question whether Congress, by the
constitution, has any more right to establish slavery <i>any where</i> than it
has to establish an inquisition, create an order of nobility, or anoint a
king.</p>

</div>


<p>
<span class="smcap">Gentlemen of the Jury</span>;<br>
</p>

<p>I rise before you under circumstances rarely exceeded
in embarrassment. I am an utter stranger to
his honor, the judge, and to all of you, gentlemen,
who compose the jury. Among all the eager faces in
this crowded hall, there is not one with which I am
familiar. I suppose there is not one man in this vast
assembly who has any sympathy for my client or
for me.</p>

<p>The case before us is acknowledged, on all sides,
to be one of great moment. It directly affects human
interests,—large pecuniary interests,—and these are
among the most active and powerful of human impulses.
It is a case which has given birth to great excitement.
It has been narrated with formidable exaggerations in
the public papers; it has been angrily discussed in both
houses of Congress, and bruited over the land. From
what has transpired in and about this court room, since
the trial commenced, I perceive that each individual
seems not only to be convinced that the prisoner at the
bar has committed a great offence, but, like a light<span class="pagenum" id="Page_85">[Pg 85]</span>
reflected from a multiplying glass, he sees that offence
multiplied a thousand fold in the opinions and feelings
of those around him. I cannot forbear to add, that it
is a case, also, which, in some of its aspects, touches
the deepest and tenderest sympathies of the human
heart; for this prosecution not only deals with human
beings as offenders, but with human beings and human
rights, as the subject matters of the offence.</p>

<p>We have been called to trial, too, at an untimely
hour. I have not had time for the preparation and
investigation which so important a case demands.
Added to this, my colleague, [Mr. <span class="smcap">Carlisle</span>,] was taken
ill on the day he was retained, and, until the evening
immediately preceding the commencement of the
trial, I had no opportunity for a single interview with
him, and then but for an hour, in his sick chamber.
During all this time, too, as some of you may know,
my attention has been called away by official duties
elsewhere.</p>

<p>Gentlemen, let me come a little closer to my relations
to this case and to yourselves. I stand here, on
this side of the table; you sit there, on the other side.
Our <i>persons</i> are near to each other; but should I not
greatly deceive myself, were I to suppose that our
<i>opinions</i> were as near together as our persons? We
are within shaking-hands’ distance of each other; still,
our convictions and sentiments on certain subjects
may be wide asunder as the poles. On a subject of
vast importance and gravity,—a subject reflected from
every feature of this case,—I was born, and from my
birth have been trained up, in one set of ideas; and I
mean no discourtesy when I say that you have been
born and trained in another set of ideas. Hence it is natural,
yes, it is inevitable,—is it not?—that we should
approach this subject with widely different views, and,
as it were, from opposite points of the moral compass.
I am admonished, then, in the outset, that your prepossessions<span class="pagenum" id="Page_86">[Pg 86]</span>
are against me. The frame of your minds
must be adverse to the reception of my views. We
are in a position where the hearer, consciously or unconsciously,
braces himself against the pressure of
the speaker’s arguments. And of all difficult positions
in which advocate or orator was ever placed, the most
difficult is that of encountering the honest antipathies
of his hearers. The heart, secure in its own convictions,
closes itself against the argument that would
overthrow them, as a fond parent bars his doors against
the foe that would carry away his children.</p>

<p>But, gentlemen, amid all these adverse circumstances,
and amid these conflicts of hostile and perhaps
irreconcilable feelings, is there not some common
ground on which you and I can stand together, and
greet each other as brethren? Is there not one spot
where we can stand side by side, as friends, sympathize
with each other, and act together in harmony?
Yes, gentlemen, there <i>is</i> one such spot. <i>It is the
ground of</i> <span class="allsmcap">DUTY</span>. In this case, I have certain duties
to perform; you, too, have certain duties to perform;
and the feeling of a common duty is always creative
of the feeling of brotherhood. We are called to these
duties as by the voice of God; we are to perform
them as under the eye of the Omniscient. Here we
are embarked in a common cause. From this moment,
then, let all feelings of alienation or repugnance be
banished from between us.</p>

<p>Gentlemen, this prisoner has requested me to be his
counsel; and I, perhaps unwisely, have acceded to his
request. I have taken an oath to be true to him.
This has imposed certain responsibilities upon me,
which, before Heaven, I may not escape. In this I
find my strength. With the fierce excitement, which
blazed forth in this District when the prisoners of the
“Pearl” were first arrested, still hot around me; with
the generally adverse feelings which I suppose you<span class="pagenum" id="Page_87">[Pg 87]</span>
entertain towards the side of the cause which I have
espoused, and therefore against its advocate; with
these thronged spectators, who show, at every turn
and incident of the trial, what their feelings are towards
the prisoner and his defenders, I should not be able
to stand here one moment, were it not for the supporting,
uplifting sentiment, glowing through every fibre
of my frame, that I am here in the performance of a
high and holy duty. In all else I may be weak; in
this I am strong.<a id="FNanchor_4" href="#Footnote_4" class="fnanchor">[4]</a></p>

<p>So you, gentlemen, sit there to perform a duty.
Swearing upon the Holy Evangelists, you have invoked
the vengeance of Heaven upon your souls, if, consciously
and wittingly, you swerve a hair’s breadth from
the line of rectitude; if you allow any partiality in
favor of a cherished institution, or any prejudice against
the prisoner, to close your eyes or blind your minds to
any fact of evidence or rule of law which may be adduced
in his behalf.</p>

<p>I might even add a consideration of a lighter nature
leading to the same result. Your fortune and mine,
for some days to come, I suppose to be settled. I
know not how protracted this trial may be, but, gentlemen,
we are in it, for longer or shorter, for better or
worse; and while we are in it, we shall be obliged to
come together from day to day, and live in each other’s
presence and company. Now, I trust you have too
much philosophy about you to make bad worse. And
so of myself. Were we fellow-travellers in the same
stage-coach or steamboat, and were doomed to be so
for a week or a fortnight, it would be most unwise to
add to our inevitable discomforts that of striving to
annoy each other; so, when packed together in this
room, which seems to have been constructed for<span class="pagenum" id="Page_88">[Pg 88]</span>
creatures that do not breathe, and with the thermometer
above ninety degrees, I trust any icy feelings we
may have had towards each other will speedily melt
away. In a word, I heartily concur, and I trust you
will do the same, in the opinion of the old man who
declared, according to the anecdote, that after the experience
of a long life, he had found it best to submit
to what he could not possibly help.</p>

<p>What, then, is the business before us? Daniel Drayton
is set here at the bar charged with a grave offence,
and you are impanelled to try him. And who is
Daniel Drayton? We shall prove to you that he is a
man of sober and industrious life, against whose character,
as a just, upright, exemplary citizen, no charge
was ever before preferred. Whatever may have been
his errors in regard to the transaction which has brought
him before you, he has, in consequence of it, passed
through scenes which must move your sympathy.
He has been torn from his family and immured in a
loathsome cell. From feeling that sense of security
from lawless violence, which every man, whether guilty
or innocent, is entitled to feel, he has been in imminent
danger of being torn in pieces by an infuriated mob.
Yes, gentlemen, on Tuesday, the eighteenth day of
April last, this man, this fellow-citizen of ours, in this
capital of the nation, within sight of Congress, and of
the President’s house, and within hearing of them, too,
was pursued by a mob, from near the river’s side on
the south of us to the very doors of the jail on the
north,—a mob estimated to consist of from four to
six thousand people,—many of them armed with
deadly weapons; the thrusts of a dirk knife, which
was drawn upon him, coming within an inch of his
body; amid wrathful cries of “Hang him!” “Lynch
him!” accompanied by all the profanities and abominations
of speech which usually issue from the foul throat
of that hideous monster—<span class="allsmcap">A MOB</span>. Arrived at the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_89">[Pg 89]</span>
jail, the mob besieged him there. When afterwards,
and while under examination before magistrates of the
city, a distinguished gentleman and member of Congress,
[the Hon. Joshua R. Giddings, of Ohio,] appeared
at his request and in his defence, the mob surrounded
the gates of the jail, demanding the immediate
expulsion of the counsel; and the jailer, to save
bloodshed, insisted upon his departure. The storm
swept beyond the prison and the prisoner. It assailed
all who were supposed to sympathize with him. The
office of a newspaper in this city, (the National Era,)
was threatened with demolition. At a mob meeting,
votes were passed,—without any great scrutiny, I
presume, into the qualifications of the voters,—that
the paper should be discontinued. Its editor was waited
upon at night, or at midnight, by a mob-elected
committee, and a peremptory demand was made upon
him to remove his establishment beyond the District,
or to abandon it.</p>

<p>But I will not dwell longer upon these details, so disgraceful
to the capital of a republic that calls itself
<i>free</i>, and so abhorrent to the feelings of every right-minded
man. Were I to enumerate all the perils, the
indignities, and the privations to which my client
has been subjected, the day would be too short for the
narration.</p>

<p>After Drayton’s examination, he was held to bail.
And what, think you, was the amount of the bail demanded?
Seventy-six thousand dollars! and seventy-six
thousand dollars also for each of the other prisoners,—$228,000
for the seventy-six alleged slaves, when the
common market value of such slaves in this neighborhood
would not, I suppose, be more than three or four
hundred dollars apiece;—and though all of them, too,
had been returned, and were in possession of their claimants
at the time. Has the fact never yet come to the
knowledge of the magistrates of the District of Columbia,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_90">[Pg 90]</span>
that the constitution of the United States
declares that “excessive bail shall not be required”?</p>

<p>But, gentlemen, these are not the only hardships and
oppressions to which my client has been subjected.
How many, at the most, are the offences against the
laws of this District which he has committed? He
came here on the 13th of April, in the schooner Pearl.
He departed on the 15th. On the 17th, he was arrested
near the mouth of the Potomac, with a company of
alleged slaves on board his vessel. Was not this
all one transaction? Can it be divided and separated
into a multitude of distinct offences? Can this one
deed be made an offence against different laws? If not,
then there is another clause in the constitution set at
nought,—that clause which declares that no person
shall be “subject for the same offence to be twice put
in jeopardy of life or limb.”</p>

<p>And yet, gentlemen, what do we find on the records
of this court? One hundred and fifteen indictments
against this prisoner for this one act; and one hundred
and fifteen indictments also against each of the other
prisoners for engaging in the same. Three hundred
and forty-five indictments! Reams of indictments for
a single deed! Nor is this the only injustice. Each
of the prisoners is indicted for having violated, by this
one act, separate and distinct laws. There is an old law
of Maryland against stealing slaves, and another law
against transporting them out of the jurisdiction; and
these laws are claimed, by virtue of an act of Congress,
to be in force in this District. Now, if the prisoner
stole the slaves, he is not guilty of the separate offence
of transporting. If he is guilty of transporting, he
is not guilty of stealing. That the two offences should
have been committed by one and the same act, is a
legal impossibility. If the grand jury first found the
prisoner guilty of the offence of stealing the slaves,
they thereby declared that he was not guilty of the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_91">[Pg 91]</span>
different offence of transporting. Or, if they first
found him guilty of the offence of transporting, they
thereby declared that he was not guilty of the separate
offence of stealing. To proceed, therefore, after a finding
for one offence, to charge the prisoner with the
other, was not only a legal absurdity, but a grievous
injustice.</p>

<p>Besides, if these slaves were stolen, as is alleged,
from forty-one different masters, the whole might have
been charged in different counts in the same indictment,
and the prisoner might be found guilty upon as
many of the counts as law and evidence would warrant.</p>

<p>So there was but one act of transportation. Even,
therefore, if it were just to charge the prisoner with
the breach of two different laws for the same act,
still, as the transportation of the whole was but one,
it should have been charged only in one indictment.</p>

<p>See how fatal to any man must such a course of
proceeding be. If the stealing were charged in one
indictment, it would be tried by one jury; and the
evidence being to a great degree the same, the whole
trial might be brought within a limited period of time.
But with forty-one indictments, there must be forty-one
trials, before forty-one different juries; for neither
government nor prisoner would consent that a jury,
who had given an adverse verdict, should try another
of the cases. Now, gentlemen, I care not for the enormous
expense of such a proceeding,—ten dollars on
each indictment, enuring to the benefit of the district
attorney,—</p>

<p>Here Mr. <span class="smcap">Key</span>, the district attorney, interrupted and
said: If Mr. Mann thinks I am to have ten dollars on
each of these indictments, he is mistaken; and in my
argument to the jury I shall deny it.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Carlisle</span>. Mr. Mann is not mistaken in the
general statement, that the district attorney receives
ten dollars on each indictment. He receives ten dollars<span class="pagenum" id="Page_92">[Pg 92]</span>
on each, until the income of his office amounts to
six thousand dollars a year. It is only when the
emoluments of the office reach that sum that he ceases
to draw his ten dollars on each indictment.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Mann</span>. I was saying, gentlemen, that I care
comparatively nothing for the amount of expense incurred
in consequence of these three hundred and
forty-five indictments. Far graver consequences than
the mere expenditure of money are involved. Who
can maintain or survive a contest against such a host
of indictments, sustained by all the power and resources
of the government? Were a man rich as Crœsus,
it would exhaust his means. Were he brave as a
martyr, it would outweary his endurance. Were he
innocent as a child unborn, still, on the mere doctrine
of chances, he might fail in some one case, out of such
a multitude. Were he in the prime of life, its setting
sun might go down in darkness and sorrow before the
final verdict of acquittal could be pronounced in his
favor. Under such a practice with regard to indictments,
coupled with such a practice in regard to bail,
an accusation would be as fatal as crime itself, however
innocent the accused might be. The law provides
a statute of limitations as to offences. Could it have
foreseen such an abuse as this, it would have provided
a statute of limitations against the number of prosecutions
for a single offence; for the government might as
well try a man, on a separate indictment, for each hair
of a horse he had stolen, and hold him, on each of
them, to separate bail. The English courts, gentlemen,
have provided a remedy for the beginnings of
this injustice. They have decided, again and again,
that when even two indictments are found against a
man for the same offence, they will compel the prosecutor
to make his election between them,—to proceed
upon one and abandon the other. 2 Leach’s Cr. Cas.,
608, <i>Rex</i> vs. <i>Doran</i>. 3 Carr. &amp; P. 412, <i>Rex</i> vs. <i>Smith</i>.<span class="pagenum" id="Page_93">[Pg 93]</span>
Ib. <i>Rex</i> vs. <i>Flower</i>, 413. 3 T. R. <i>Young</i> vs. <i>The
King</i>, (<i>in error</i>,) 106. See, also, in support of the
same principle, New York Revised Statutes, vol.
2, part 4, ch. 2, § 42, where provision is made that
“if there be at any time pending against the same
defendant two or more indictments for the same
offence, or two indictments for the same matter,
although charged as different offences, the indictment
first found shall be deemed to be superseded by such
second indictment, and shall be quashed.”</p>

<p>But, gentlemen, there is another aspect of this case,
which presents, in a manner still more glaring, the
enormity of the proceeding to which we are subjected.
Under each of the forty-one indictments against this
prisoner for stealing, he is liable, if convicted, to be
sentenced to twenty years’ imprisonment, which would
make an aggregate imprisonment of more than eight
hundred years. Methuselah himself must have been
caught young, in order to survive such a sentence.
The very shortest time which the court, in its discretion,
could imprison, after a conviction on all these indictments,
would be two hundred and eighty-seven
years! Did the law ever contemplate so cruel and revengeful
a proceeding? Did the law ever suppose that
the court, after having sentenced a man to eight hundred
years’ imprisonment, or even to two hundred and
eighty years’ imprisonment, should go on, and sentence
him to twenty years, or even to seven years more?—when
the court must know that it would be imposing
sentences to be executed centuries after the prisoner
would be dead, and after he would have left his prison,
not to return to this world, but to go to another.</p>

<p>But even this is not all. Behind these forty-one
indictments for stealing stand drawn up, in battle array,
against this same prisoner, seventy-four other indictments
for transporting the very slaves whom he is
charged to have stolen. The penalty for each of these<span class="pagenum" id="Page_94">[Pg 94]</span>
offences is a fine of two hundred dollars, with imprisonment
till paid. The aggregate of these fines would
be $14,800. But a penalty not inflicted by the statute,
but superadded by this unwarrantable proceeding of
the government, is the defence of seventy-four successive
cases, under which the wealthiest, the strongest,
and the most innocent man must break down, and be
swept to ruin.</p>

<p>Corresponding with the oppressive character of all
these preliminaries was the manner of the prosecutor,
in his opening argument. He has seen fit to use
language against the prisoner the most vehement and
denunciatory. He has imputed to him every base
motive that can actuate a depraved heart, and showered
upon him the coarsest epithets that can describe a
villain. Now if it shall turn out that my client is innocent,
then all these criminations are unjust and
cruel; and even should it be proved that he is guilty,
it is no part of his punishment to be compelled to sit
here in enforced silence, hour after hour, and hear
himself denounced and vilified in language as unfitted
to his character as to the sobriety of judicial proceedings.</p>

<p>Gentlemen, the representative of the government,
like the government itself, should be dispassionate and
calm. Majesty is one of the attributes of sovereignty,
and serenity is inseparable from majesty. The government
is not a being of wrath, of ferocity, of vindictiveness;
and the exhibition of such passions is as
unsuitable to the representative of the government as
to the government itself. Though the image of justice
may be represented as holding the sword of power
in one hand, yet she is also represented as holding the
balance of equity in the other; but when the government
assumes the guilt of the prisoner, before it has
been found, and denounces him in bitterest epithets as
criminal, while as yet the law presumes him to be innocent,—the
only proper emblem of such a government<span class="pagenum" id="Page_95">[Pg 95]</span>
is an image which, a few years ago, might have
been seen surmounting the dome of the court house in
Taunton, in the county of Somersetshire, in England,
to which the artist had originally given both the balance
and the sword; but a storm, careering through
the sky, had swept the balance away, so that nothing
but the avenging sword was left; and there the hateful
figure stood aloft, an image of wrath untempered
by equity.</p>

<p>But, gentlemen, let me trust that the prisoner has at
length escaped from the turbulent and perilous scenes
which have hitherto destroyed his peace and threatened
his life. Let me trust that the fell spirits which
prompted the proposal, made by one of his captors
while he was yet on board the steamboat, and previous
to his return to this city, that he should be
brought up and hung at the yard-arm,—as was testified
to by the government’s witnesses,—is at length
exorcised; let me trust that the demoniac cry of vengeance
which was shouted by the mob, and the thirst
for blood which their conduct betokened, while the
prisoner, bound and defenceless, was conducted from
the river to the jail, has found no welcoming response
in your bosoms. Let me trust, also, that the violence
of manner and the bitterness of language which have
been so freely employed in the opening of this case,
have not disturbed the balance of your minds, or so
ruffled their serenity that the images of truth shall be
distorted as they are reflected from them.</p>

<p>Gentlemen, the spot on which a jury are seated
should be a place separate and apart from the rest of
the world; sacred, and inaccessible to the passions and
prejudices that move the community without. It
should be a place consecrated to the inquiry, “What
is truth?” and to the application of its conclusions to
the conduct of men. When you took your seats in
that place, you were severally asked by the court<span class="pagenum" id="Page_96">[Pg 96]</span>
whether you had formed any opinion respecting the
guilt or innocence of the prisoner, and you severally
answered in the negative. The final opinion, then,
which shall be expressed in your verdict, must be
an opinion which you have formed <i>since</i> that time,
and from the law and testimony here introduced.
Into that opinion, no other element must be allowed
to enter. The prejudged guilt of the prisoner, as manifested
by repeated attempts to take his life; the demand
which may exist, and which I suppose does
exist, out of doors, that he shall be convicted, innocent
or guilty; the anticipation that you are to meet an
angry community, if you acquit him;—all these considerations,
if they obtrude upon your minds, must be
sternly rebuked and banished. The record of your
verdict will survive these temporary excitements. It
should be a verdict, therefore, which you can look
upon, at the close of life, with conscientious satisfaction.
It must be one which your children can look at
with a filial and honorable regard for their fathers’ uprightness.
In a case which has excited so much attention,
both here and throughout the country, you, too,
must expect to be put on trial; your verdict will go
into the great record of history, to be passed upon by
your country and by posterity.</p>

<p>Once, gentlemen, in the state to which I belong, a
case arose in which the deepest and holiest feelings of
the community were intensely excited. One of the
preludes to the great drama of the American revolution
was the slaughtering, in the year 1770, of five
American citizens, in the streets of Boston, by the
British soldiery. The supposed offenders were brought
to trial for the homicide. They were defended by
John Adams and Josiah Quincy,—illustrious names!
The public breast throbbed with excitement. The
sight of butchered countrymen made the blood seethe
in the hearts of their fellow-citizens. If there ever<span class="pagenum" id="Page_97">[Pg 97]</span>
could be a case where the law might be wrested to
meet the popular outcry for redress; if there ever
could be a case where the evidence might be strained
and distorted to bring the facts within strained and
distorted law, so as to visit a high outrage with a
moral, if not a legal penalty, the “Boston Massacre”
of 1770 supplied all its conditions. That cause was
tried, and the prisoners were acquitted. The storm
of popular disaffection soon cleared away, and now
twelve purer and fairer names are not inscribed
on the roll of fame than the names of those twelve
jurymen, who dared to brave public opinion, and to
perform an act of arduous, if not of perilous justice.
Noble and illustrious bravery of the soul, which, when
the yelling fiends of popular passion and prejudice
beset the ascending pathway of virtue, can look to
conscience, to posterity, and to God, and defy them all!
Follow their example, gentlemen, and, whatever fierce
sounds of public condemnation may be now rung in
your ears, you will have the same glorious reward, and
your children, and all the good men of your country,
will honor your memories.</p>

<p>Gentlemen, in the vehement appeals which were
made to you by the government’s counsel, for the condemnation
of the prisoner, you were told that he had
“invaded this District, and ruthlessly carried away
more than a hundred thousand dollars’ worth of its
property;” and you were warned that, if you let such
a man escape, you might as well abandon at once all
property in slaves. But it so happens, gentlemen, that
you are sworn to try this prisoner for stealing John and
Sam, two slaves of one Andrew Hoover, of the alleged
value of fourteen hundred dollars only. Is each of
these forty-one cases against the prisoner to be inflamed
and exasperated by charging him with plundering the
District to the amount of more than a hundred thousand
dollars? A pretty strong effort of fancy, is it not?<span class="pagenum" id="Page_98">[Pg 98]</span>
to work up the fourteen hundred dollars of the indictment
into more than four millions in the argument!
Is this to be another of the oppressive consequences
of multiplying the one alleged offence of the prisoner
into forty-one separate offences? Is the government’s
counsel to botch up any sort of nefarious charge
against the prisoner, and then call upon you to find him
guilty on these strained and overwrought exaggerations
of his conduct? No, gentlemen! This would
be to suppose that you sit there to administer the worst
kind of Lynch law,—a kind that has all its injustice,
while screening itself from the odium of its violence.
The object of civil society is to protect rights and to
redress wrongs. For these great purposes laws are enacted,
courts are established, juries are instituted, and
rules of evidence are framed. Without civil society,
each man would have a right to preserve his own
rights and to redress his own wrongs. Civil society
takes away something from a man’s rights, but it adds
immensely to his powers; it makes him stronger than
any individual oppressor, and, on the whole, it protects
its members far better than they could protect themselves.
But civil society, like every thing human, is
imperfect. Once out of ten times, or once out of
twenty times, it may fail to accomplish the end for
which it was established. The very instruments it
has framed may sometimes be the cause of its failure.
What then? We do but fail in each tenth, or each
twentieth case, when, without the social organization,
failure might have been the general rule. And, therefore,
even if a guilty person does sometimes escape, all
we can say is that civil society has not done its work
infallibly. It has done well, though it has not done all.
But suppose this very civil society, wielding as it does
the combined and terrible strength of the whole community,
should turn its collected force against an innocent
man, and crush him, then in what an utter and<span class="pagenum" id="Page_99">[Pg 99]</span>
hopeless ruin is he overwhelmed! How much better
for him had its powerful machinery never existed, than
that he should be ground to powder beneath its wheels!
Now, such might be the case with every prisoner, if
juries were to act without strict obedience to law, and
a strict observance of the forms of law. Any appeals,
therefore, made to you, that because this prisoner may
have committed <i>some</i> offence against law, you are,
therefore, to discard all scruples and find him guilty of
<i>this</i> offence, I regard as treason against justice, as a
monstrous perversion of judicial proceedings; yes, as
a thousand times worse than any guilt of the prisoner,
even supposing the distorted features of the picture,
drawn by the government’s counsel, to be genuine. It
would be nothing less than Lynch law, perpetrated by
twelve picked and sworn men, instead of a mob.</p>

<p>Gentlemen, the district attorney in his opening has
not deigned to tell us on what law he proceeds. He
has accused the prisoner of stealing often enough, but
has read no statute, and referred to no decision,
which creates or describes any such offence. Hence a
task which clearly belonged to him is devolved upon
me.</p>

<p>After the District of Columbia was ceded to the
United States, Congress passed a general law, adopting
the laws of Maryland, for that part of the District
which had been ceded by Maryland. This trial, therefore,
must proceed upon laws originally passed by
Maryland. By the act of 1737, ch. 2, § 4, it is provided
that any person “who shall steal any negro or
other slave,” “or who shall counsel, hire, aid, abet, or
command any person or persons” to do so, shall suffer
death as a felon. The punishment has since been
changed to imprisonment in the United States prison,
for a term of not less than seven, nor more than
twenty years. [Here comments were made at length on
the preamble of the statute, and the class of cases to
which the law was intended to apply.]</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_100">[Pg 100]</span></p>

<p>This act was designed to prevent slaves from being
<i>stolen</i>. But a man might lose a slave without his being
stolen. The slave might be enticed or persuaded to
run away. Experience, doubtless, made the masters
aware of this. Hence, fourteen years afterwards, by
the act of 1751, ch. 14, § 10, it was provided that “if
any person shall entice and persuade any slave within
this province to run away, and who shall actually run
away from the master,” &amp;c., he shall be punished, &amp;c.</p>

<p>But there was still another way of depriving a
master of the service of his slave. Hence the act of
1796, ch. 67, § 19, made it a separate and distinct offence
for any person to be guilty of “the transporting
of any slave or person, held to service,” from the
state.</p>

<p>Now, here, gentlemen, are four distinct legal provisions,
all designed to protect slave property. By these
provisions, four distinct legal offences are created.
The law, by creating and defining these offences, has
authoritatively declared that one of them is not either
of the others of them. “Stealing” is one thing.
“Counselling, hiring,” &amp;c., a man to steal, is not
stealing itself. “Enticing and persuading” a slave to
run away from his master is not stealing. “Transporting”
a slave out of the jurisdiction is not stealing.
The inquiry for you, therefore, is whether the prisoner
is guilty of any of these offences, and if of any, then,
of which.</p>

<p>Now, gentlemen, let me take advantage of a map
which is lying here accidentally before me, to illustrate
this case. Four states,—Pennsylvania, Maryland,
Virginia, and North Carolina, are here represented. The
boundaries between them are distinctly marked. Pennsylvania
is not Maryland, nor either of the others.
Maryland is not Virginia, nor either of the others; and
so of the rest. Just so it is with the offences created
by these statutes. Any one of them is not either of<span class="pagenum" id="Page_101">[Pg 101]</span>
the others. It is as plain that the offence of “transporting”
a slave out of the jurisdiction is as different
from the offence of stealing a slave, as this geographical
shape of Maryland is different from this geographical
shape of Pennsylvania. As, therefore, if the geographical
metes and bounds of the State of Maryland
were shown to you, you could not say, upon your
oaths, that it was a description of the State of Pennsylvania;
so, if the offence of “transporting” be proved
to you, you cannot say, on your oaths, that it is the
offence of stealing.</p>

<p>Or take an illustration from other things. The object
of a sun-dial, a watch, a clock, and a chronometer
is the same. All are made for the measurement of
time, as all these laws were made for the protection of
slave property. But could you, therefore, on your
oaths, convict a man of stealing a chronometer, when
he had only taken a clock or a watch? No, you could
find him guilty only of the thing proved to have been
done.</p>

<p>Or, again, suppose a law should be made to protect a
man’s property in his books; and the stealing of books,
generally, should be punishable by five years’ confinement
in the penitentiary. Such a general law would
include all books. Suppose a subsequent law should
inflict a lighter penalty for stealing an octavo volume,
and a still lighter one for a duodecimo. Then it would
be necessary, in an indictment, to set out the kind of
book stolen, and no man could be lawfully punished
for the weightier offence who had only committed the
lighter. So here, the first law punished “stealing,”
the next “enticing,” and the next “transporting.”</p>

<p>Now, gentlemen, I maintain that, at most, nothing
but the offence of “transporting” has been proved
against this prisoner. But he is arraigned for <i>stealing</i>.
What then, let us inquire, are the ingredients which
constitute the offence of stealing,—which are indispensable<span class="pagenum" id="Page_102">[Pg 102]</span>
to its perpetration? They are, 1. That the
property shall be taken by the thief from the possession
of the owner. 2. That it shall be taken into the
possession of the thief,—that is, that the taker shall
exercise some act of control or ownership over it.
And, 3. That this taking by the thief, from the possession
of the owner, and into his own possession, shall be
for the felonious purpose of converting the said property
to his own use.</p>

<p>Now, I think it is not too much to say, that neither
one of these three indispensable ingredients of larceny
has been proved in this case.</p>

<p>1. It is not proved that the prisoner took the two
slaves mentioned in the indictment <i>from the possession</i>
of Andrew Hoover. Could not some other person besides
the prisoner have put it into the heads of these
slaves to leave their master? There are white men in
this city hostile to the institution of slavery, and desiring
the freedom of all slaves. Could they not have
said to Hoover’s slaves, “Here is a schooner at the
wharf; it is to sail at such a time; be there, and you
may escape to a free state”? Here, too, are thousands
of free negroes, or colored persons, in this District,
with whom the slaves are in daily and open communication.
Could they not have infused into the mind of
these slaves the idea of liberty? Is it not a thousand
times more probable that it was done by some citizen
in the District, or by some colored acquaintance or
friend of theirs, enjoying the means of constant communication
with them, than that it was done by an
entire stranger to them, as the prisoner was? Can
aught be conceived more absurd or preposterous than
that the prisoner should go round the streets of Washington,
picking up a slave here and there, to complete
his cargo, as the driver of a stage-coach goes round
picking up passengers? Should he accost a colored
man in the streets, and ask him if he were a slave, the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_103">[Pg 103]</span>
chances are three to one that the person addressed
would turn out to be a freeman; for I suppose the
proportion, in this District, of the free colored persons
to the slaves to be as great as this. If the fourth
man or woman he might meet should prove to be a
slave, how could he know but what he might be addressing
one so attached to the place, to his home and
relatives, and to his master, that even the sweets of
freedom would not tempt him to leave; and that the
consequence would be an immediate reporting of the
interview, and sudden detection and punishment? But
a person on the spot would know who were slaves,
and what slaves were discontented with their condition;
he could select the occasion when a slave had been
punished by his master, when his body was smarting,
and his mind was fired with indignation against him,
and then sow the seeds of discontent and the hopes
of escape in a fruitful soil. If, then, the slaves were,
in fact, instigated to leave their master’s possession,
the probabilities are a thousand to one that they were
so instigated by some other person or persons resident
here, and not by the prisoner. If this were so, and
they came on board the prisoner’s schooner, after having
absconded from their master, then he did not take them
from Hoover’s possession, and so is not guilty of the first
ingredient in the crime of larceny.</p>

<p>But is there not still another way in which slaves
may be induced to leave the possession of their master?
Though we may call men slaves, yet are they
not human beings?—degraded from the natural dignity
of manhood, it is true, and dwarfed in their mental
stature, but still human beings; subject to the passions
of our common nature, animated by its hopes, inflamed
by its resentments, and shrinking and flying through
fear from the uplifted rod. As human beings, could
not the desire of escape from their master’s possession
have originated with themselves?—prompted by the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_104">[Pg 104]</span>
inward and instinctive longings for liberty, which
spring perennial in the human breast.</p>

<p>The attorney for the government, in his opening,
dwelt long and earnestly on the value of this species
of property. He described it as the most valuable
kind of property known in the District, and therefore
most vigilantly to be guarded. Doubtless it has a
certain pecuniary value; and, as it increases in intelligence,
activity, and skill, its value is greatly enhanced.
But with this enhanced value comes a <i>per contra</i>.
With increased intelligence and mental development,
the desires natural to manhood spring up;—the longing
for liberty, and for the possession of free agency;
the desire of selecting one’s own field of labor, and
means of enjoyment; the desire of commanding the
rewards of one’s own toil. So that, as the value of a
slave increases, the strength of the tenure by which he
is held becomes less secure. It is a weight of gold
suspended by a cord. The master wishes to increase
the mass. He adds little by little, until the weight
snaps the cord, and he loses the whole.</p>

<p>Hoover says he had been offered $1400 for the
two slaves mentioned in the indictment, and had refused
the offer. Their services were probably worth to him
a dollar a day each. One of them was employed in
driving a cart about the city. As he saw a handful
of money paid to his master every week, or every
month, for his own earnings, think you he never asked
himself, why that money could not be his? When
three out of every four colored men whom he met,
from day to day, were receiving their own earnings,
and making those earnings minister to their comforts
and their pleasures, might not Hoover’s slaves have
said, “Why are not our earnings our own? and, if we
cannot possess them here, why should we not go to a
country where the laborer is deemed, in the language
of Scripture, to be worthy of his hire?” and so have<span class="pagenum" id="Page_105">[Pg 105]</span>
fled of their own accord? for, though we are prone to
apply the precepts of the gospel to others rather than
to ourselves, yet this is a passage which they would be
likely to take home.</p>

<p>But this is not all, gentlemen. In this capital of a
nation so boastful of its freedom, the common air is
vocal with the accents of liberty. Many of the colored
people can read. Who knows but some of them have
read the Declaration of American Independence; and,
<i>in their blindness and simplicity of mind</i>, applied its
immortal truths to themselves? “All men are created
equal!” and among their “inalienable rights” “are
life, <span class="allsmcap">LIBERTY</span>, and the pursuit of happiness!” Who
knows but that they may have seen these doctrines,
with a constellation of names subscribed to them
as glorious as any that ever shone in history’s firmament?
If such ideas once got possession of a man’s
mind, do you think that fire or water could ever burn
them or drown them out? Those who cannot read,
can hear; and if you are to keep from them the perpetually
recurring sights and sounds which must
awaken the quick instincts of liberty, you must extinguish
their eyes, and seal up their ears in everlasting
silence. The last spring was one of peculiar “refreshing”
to the ardent lovers of liberty. The recent events
of Europe were the theme of every tongue. Not
only in the market-place, in the street, and in after-dinner
conversations, was the emancipation of Europe
the subject of discussion, but stormy eloquence rushed
forth from the capital of the nation, like winds from
the cave of Æolus, and roared and raved till all but
the dead must have heard it. Nay, more, gentlemen,
one of the witnesses identified the day when the defendant’s
schooner, the Pearl, came to anchor in the
waters of this city, because he remembered it as the
day of the “torchlight procession.” And what was
the “torchlight procession”? You all know;—drums<span class="pagenum" id="Page_106">[Pg 106]</span>
beating, music playing, bonfires blazing, the
house of the President and of high official dignitaries
illuminated, the trees of the avenue fancifully lighted
up with many-colored lanterns; men, women, children,
and slaves, all out, and all agog to see and to hear
of the wonderful things which “liberty” had done,
or had <i>not</i> done, on the other side of the Atlantic.
There, too, moved in long procession men who were
elected for the occasion, from among the nation’s elect,—heads
of departments, senators, and representatives,—men
distended almost to bursting with eloquence
for regenerated Europe, who must speak or die!
They marched to an open space on Pennsylvania Avenue,
where, on an extempore rostrum, they eased
themselves of their repletion of patriotism; while people
of all kinds, conditions, and colors stood below,
empty and agape, to receive what the upper divinities
might send down. And now let me read to you, gentlemen
of the jury, some of the precious things that
were said on that memorable evening,—only two
nights before the escape of the slaves in the schooner
Pearl,—and see, after you have tasted of the yeast,
if you can wonder at the fermentation:—</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>“——Events which hold out <i>to the whole family of man</i>
so bright a promise of <i>the universal establishment of</i> <span class="allsmcap">CIVIL</span>
<i>and religious liberty</i>, and the general destruction of monarchical
power throughout the world.”</p>

<p>“New and endearing ties”—“between the people of liberated
France, and <i>the twenty millions of freemen</i> who dwell,
in all the plenitude of social and political happiness, between
the great seas which water the eastern and western shores of
this vast continent.”</p>

<p>“I feel authorized to declare that there is <i>not one</i> in this
vast multitude whose sympathies are not deeply enkindled in
behalf of France and Frenchmen.”</p>

<p>“——Such has been the extraordinary course of events in
France, and in Europe, within the last two months, that the
more deliberately we survey the scene which has been spread<span class="pagenum" id="Page_107">[Pg 107]</span>
out before us, and the more rigidly we scrutinize the conduct
of its actors, the more confident does our conviction become
that the <i>glorious work</i> which has been so well begun cannot
possibly fail of complete accomplishment; that the age of
<span class="allsmcap">TYRANTS AND SLAVERY</span> is rapidly drawing to a close; and that
the happy period to be signalized by the <i>universal emancipation
of man</i> from the <i>fetters of civil oppression</i>, and the recognition
<i>in all countries</i> of the great principles of <i>popular sovereignty,
equality, and</i> <span class="allsmcap">BROTHERHOOD</span>, is, at this moment, visibly
commencing.”</p>


<div class="blockquot">

<p>[Here Judge <span class="smcap">Crawford</span> broke in, with great sharpness, and said,
“Mr. <span class="smcap">Mann</span>, such inflammatory language cannot be allowed in this
court. We have institutions that may be endangered by it. The
court thinks it its duty to interfere. The counsel cannot be allowed
to proceed with such inflammatory language.”</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Carlisle</span> here rose, and, for the space of ten or fifteen minutes,
with the crowded audience hushed to a grave-like silence, he interspersed
resistless logic with noble sentiments, in a strain of eloquence
rarely, if ever, surpassed. He vindicated every word his colleague
had said, both as to matter and manner, and obtested Heaven to preserve
American tribunals of justice from following the examples of
the worst times of English judicial tyranny, when the basest minions
of the crown were elevated to the bench, that they might overawe
and abash counsel in their defence of prisoners whom the king had
foredoomed to punishment.</p>

<p>Judge <span class="smcap">Crawford</span>. (Trembling with emotion.) Mr. <span class="smcap">Mann’s</span> course
of argument was perfectly legitimate. It was the inflammatory language
that I objected to. It was the language, and not the argument,
that was objectionable.]</p>
</div>
</div>
<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Mann</span>. Gentlemen of the jury, as the interdict
against the line of argument I was pursuing,—now
acknowledged to be just and proper,—has been withdrawn,
I take it up where I left it, and proceed.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Key</span>, district attorney. I demand to know
from what paper the gentleman reads.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Mann</span>. (Holding up the paper and pointing to
its heading.) From Mr. Ritchie’s Washington Union,
of April 20th. Isn’t that good authority on this
subject?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Key</span>. From whose speech does the gentleman
read?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Mann</span>. From the speech of the Hon. Henry<span class="pagenum" id="Page_108">[Pg 108]</span>
S. Foote, a senator in Congress from the State of
Mississippi.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Key</span>. The gentleman cannot read a paper to
the jury, unless he expects to prove it.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Mann</span>. I deny that as a principle; but, if required,
will call Mr. Foote to swear to his speech.</p>

<p>Judge <span class="smcap">Crawford</span>. Mr. Mann knows Mr. Foote did
not mean his language for <i>our</i> slaves. (A suppressed
laugh around the bar.)</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Mann</span>. May it please your honor, while nothing,
on the one hand, will ever deter me from doing
my duty to a client, yet, on the other hand, I am
moved to say that I have been trained from my youth
to such respect for a court of justice, that I would say
nothing to it or before it which should not be fitting
and appropriate, as apples of gold in pictures of silver.
Let me then restate my argument, that we may see
whether, and by whom, this rule has been departed
from. I reiterate, then, if slaves are property, they are
a peculiar kind of property. They are instinct with
the common desires of humanity, and among them one
of the deepest and strongest is the love of liberty.
And just in proportion as their value is increased by
intelligence and development, just in that proportion
is the bond weakened by which they are held. In all
places slaves hear something, but in this place they
hear much, of what is said in behalf of human liberty
and of human rights. If they hear this, and are above
the condition of brutes, they will apply it to themselves.
Every Fourth of July oration, if understood,
is a torch to light up another St. Domingo. If
they hear the word “<i>slave</i>” used in reference to those
who have been deprived of their natural rights in other
countries, they will apply that word to their own condition
in this. If they hear the word “<i>tyrants</i>” used in
reference to one who deprives others of their rights,
for “<i>tyrants</i>” they will read “<i>masters</i>;” and no<span class="pagenum" id="Page_109">[Pg 109]</span>
mortal power, or law, or art, can help it, but by blotting
out all that is human within them. The slaves in this
city are constantly hearing what must remind them
that they are slaves; and therefore they are constantly
incited to escape from their bondage. The torchlight
procession, with its speeches and parade, was <i>one</i> among
ten thousand of these incitements. The slaves, therefore,
who went on board the Pearl, might have obtained
the idea of escape from some other person than
from the prisoner,—from some orator who lays down
rules for the meridian of Europe, which do not quite
suit the meridian of America. Hence they might
have gone and applied to the prisoner for a passage.
To this he might have assented. And if so, then his
offence can be nothing beyond the offence of “transporting,”
and is not the offence of <i>stealing</i>, as charged
in this indictment.</p>

<p>And, as to the inflammatory language which the
court charges me with having used: every word
which was uttered by me, and which the court characterizes
and denounces as “inflammatory,” and thinks
not proper to be spoken in this court room, because it
may endanger the institutions of this city, was the
exact language of the Hon. Mr. Foote, senator in Congress
from the State of Mississippi, uttered by him
from the rostrum, on Pennsylvania Avenue, the most
public place in this city, on the evening of the 13th
of April last, to thousands of people there assembled,
men, women, children, negroes and all.</p>

<p>I had marked, may it please the court, several other
passages,—for this purpose most pungent and piercing,—in
the speeches of that evening, to be read on this
occasion; but as I think both court and jury are already
pretty well apprised of the pertinency and force
of my argument under this head, I shall content
myself with reading one passage more. It is from
the speech of the Hon. Frederick P. Staunton, representative<span class="pagenum" id="Page_110">[Pg 110]</span>
in Congress from Tennessee, delivered on the
same occasion, and printed in the same paper:—</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>“It has been truly said here this evening, that our example
has been of essential service to France. Who can doubt it?
How different would have been the struggle for liberty to be
secured by republicanism, if there had been no example of
a stable republican government to which the patriot could
point, for the encouragement of his people! It is said we
are propagandists. We do not, indeed, propagate our principles
with the sword of power; but there is one sense in which
we are propagandists. We cannot help being so. Our example
is contagious. In the section of this great country
where I live, on the banks of the mighty Mississippi river,
we have the true emblem of the tree of liberty. There you
may see the giant cottonwood spreading his branches widely
to the winds of heaven. Sometimes the current lays bare his
roots, and you behold them extending far around and penetrating
to an immense depth in the soil. When the season
of maturity comes, the air is filled with a cotton-like substance,
which floats in every direction, bearing, on its light
wings, the living seeds of the mighty tree. They lodge upon
every bank of sand which emerges from the bosom of the
receding tide, and soon a young forest is seen to lift its head
from the surface of the barren waste. Thus the seeds of
freedom have emanated from the tree of our liberties. They
fill the air. They are wafted to every part of the habitable
globe. And even in the barren sands of tyranny they are
destined to take root. The tree of liberty will spring up
every where, and nations shall recline in its shade.”</p>
</div>

<p>And thus, gentlemen of the jury, I say that while
some of the seeds of liberty which we scatter are
wafted to a foreign realm, and fall upon a foreign soil,
others will drop upon the hearts of bondmen and
bondwomen at home, and will there fructify and mature
into <i>their</i> appropriate harvest.</p>

<p>Such, gentlemen, are the considerations that lead
me to believe that the slaves found on board the
schooner Pearl left the possession of their masters of
their own accord, or at the private suggestion of some<span class="pagenum" id="Page_111">[Pg 111]</span>
friend, and not at that of the prisoner; or because they
were publicly incited thereto by that boastful spirit
amongst us which is forever shouting the praises of
liberty, while restricting the application of its principles.
I therefore infer that the prisoner has not committed
the act which forms the first ingredient in the
offence of larceny,—the taking of property from the
possession of the owner.</p>

<p>2. To constitute the offence of larceny, the prisoner
must have taken the slaves into his own possession.
Now, of this there is not a particle of evidence. For
aught that appears, the slaves might have been passengers,
on board his schooner, for a fare. They themselves
might have paid this fare, or others might have
paid it for them. In either case, they were no more
in possession of the prisoner than you or I are in possession
of a railroad corporation, when we travel in its
cars.</p>

<p>3. The third question is, whether, even if the prisoner
did take the slaves named in this indictment from
the possession of Andrew Hoover, and into his own
possession, he did so for the felonious purpose of converting
them to his own use.</p>

<p>The act of stealing, gentlemen, springs from the impulse
to acquire property, as a means of gratification.
This impulse or desire to obtain the means of enjoyment
is universal. The law denounces its penalties
against stealing, in order to repress the excesses of this
propensity, and to confine it to honest acquisitions.
Hence one man may interfere with the property of
another in a thousand ways, without being guilty of
stealing. It is not the mere taking of another man’s
property, therefore, which constitutes stealing, but the
taking of it <i>in order to convert it to the use of the taker</i>,
and so to save himself the labor of earning it. Hence
I may take a man’s plough from his field, or his wagon
from his barn, and use them temporarily; but if I<span class="pagenum" id="Page_112">[Pg 112]</span>
return them again to the owner, it is not stealing, but
only a trespass. So, according to the books, I may
take a man’s horse from his stable, ride him thirty
miles, in order to flee from justice, and then, if I abandon
the horse, it is not stealing. It is only a trespass.</p>

<p>The doctrine, gentlemen, which I wish to enforce
upon your minds, is, that every act of taking another
man’s property is not stealing. When a wag, riding
with a clergyman to church, took his sermon from his
pocket, for the purpose of enjoying his embarrassment
when he should get into the pulpit, and find himself
in the presence of the enemy without any ammunition,
such taking was not stealing; for doubtless the rogue
had no intention of appropriating either the sermon or
its morals to his own use.</p>

<p>So it is related of Sir Walter Scott, that, when he
was a boy at school, he got within one of the head of
his class. But the boy at the head never made a mistake,
and so he stood there, as perseveringly as the
letter A stands at the head of the alphabet. But Sir
Walter observed that, when his classmate was reciting,
his fingers always fumbled with a button on his jacket,
and, watching his opportunity at their next romping
on the playground, he cut off the button from his
rival’s jacket; and, at the very next lesson, the boy,
being disconcerted at not finding the button, missed
his answer, and Sir Walter rose to the head. But
surely this was not stealing.</p>

<p>The reason why, in each of these cases, one would
not be guilty of stealing, is, that he does not mean to
make the article taken his own. He gets a temporary
advantage from it, but does no act that proves a design
of permanent or unlimited ownership. Hence there
is the broadest and most striking difference between
stealing and malicious mischief. If one man takes the
property of another, merely to destroy or annihilate it,
out of ill will or revenge towards the owner, this is<span class="pagenum" id="Page_113">[Pg 113]</span>
malicious mischief only, and not stealing. It is not
punished as stealing. Morally, it may be as wrong,—perhaps
worse than stealing itself. But this impulse
which prompts to the <i>destruction</i> of another man’s
property is vastly weaker than that which leads to its
<i>appropriation</i>. The latter is gratified a thousand times
where the former is once, and therefore the law visits
the former with the milder penalty. If taking property
from its owner from revenge, and for the malicious purpose
of destroying it, be not stealing, but only malicious
mischief, then surely taking the property for the benevolent
purpose of doing a kindness to the property
itself,—as to a slave,—is not stealing.</p>

<p>Take an illustration. Wild animals are the property
of no one. The undomesticated hares that run over
my fields, the pigeons that fly over my house, or the
fishes that swim in my streams, are not my property so
that they can be the subjects of larceny. If a man
takes them, he is liable in trespass for entering my
grounds, and that is all. But if I confine hares in a
warren, or pigeons in a cote, or fishes in a seine, then
they are my property, and are the subjects of larceny,
because I have reduced them to possession. Under
such circumstances, if a man shoots or catches them
for his table.—that is, to convert them to his own
use,—he steals them; but if a man merely releases
them from their confinement, breaks open their enclosures
to let them go free, he is at most only guilty
of malicious mischief. The English nobility send to
France for foxes. These are caught in the Pyrenees
or other mountains, brought across the English channel,
and placed in the parks of noblemen preparatory
to the barbarous amusement of a fox-hunt. Now, if
one lord should take a fox from the park of another
lord, for the pleasure of hunting him down, on his own
premises, this would be stealing; but if he should only
assist a fox to escape out of the park, for the benevolent<span class="pagenum" id="Page_114">[Pg 114]</span>
purpose of restoring him to his natural liberty, this
would not be stealing, but only a trespass. In such a
case, the man who enlarges the fox does not do it in
order to save himself the labor or expense of catching
a fox; that is, he does not convert the fox to his own
use.</p>

<p>Let me give you another illustration, which I select
for the beauty of the language in which it is conveyed,
and for the nobleness of the sentiments that accompany
it. In the “Sentimental Journey” of Sterne, the following
incident is related:—</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>“I was interrupted, in the heyday of this soliloquy, with a
voice which I took to be of a child, which complained, it
could not get out. I looked up and down the passage, and
seeing neither man, woman, nor child, I went out without
further attention.</p>

<p>“In my return back through the passage, I heard the same
words repeated twice over, and looking up, I saw it was a
starling, hung in a little cage. ‘I can’t get out, I can’t get out,’
said the starling.</p>

<p>“I stood looking at the bird, and to every person who came
through the passage, it ran fluttering to the side which they
approached, with the same lamentation of its captivity,—‘I
can’t get out,’ said the starling. God help thee! said I, but
I’ll let thee out, cost what it will; so I turned about the cage
to get at the door. It was twisted and double twisted so fast
with wire, there was no getting it open without pulling the
cage to pieces. I took both hands to it.</p>

<p>“The bird flew to the place where I was attempting his deliverance,
and, thrusting his head through the trellis, pressed
his breast against it as if impatient. I fear, poor creature,
said I, I cannot set thee at liberty. ‘No,’ said the starling,
‘I can’t get out. I can’t get out,’ said the starling.</p>

<p>“I vow I never had my affections more tenderly awakened.”</p>
</div>

<p>And then he bursts out into that apostrophe to
Slavery, which has thrilled the hearts of all his readers
in times past, and will continue to thrill the heart of
every reader in all time to come:—</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_115">[Pg 115]</span></p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>“Disguise thyself as thou wilt, still, Slavery, still thou art a
bitter draught! and, though thousands in all ages have been
made to drink of thee, thou art no less bitter on that account.
’Tis thou, thrice sweet and gracious goddess, <span class="smcap">Liberty</span>, whom
all in public or in private worship, whose taste is grateful, and
ever will be so till Nature herself shall change. No <i>tint</i> of
words can spot thy snowy mantle, or chemic power turn thy
sceptre into iron. With thee to smile upon him as he eats his
crust, the swain is happier than his monarch, from whose court
thou art exiled. Gracious Heaven! grant me but health,
thou great Bestower of it, and give me but this fair goddess as
my companion, and shower down thy mitres, if it seems good
unto thy divine providence, upon those heads which are
aching for them.”</p>
</div>

<p>Had Sterne released that bird, and sent it abroad to
rejoice in its native fields of air, would his myriads of
readers, who have been delighted at the story, have
convicted him of <i>stealing</i>?</p>

<p>Now for the application. These slaves, by the law
of nature, were as free as you or I. By the law and
force of man, they have been subjected to bondage.
If the prisoner took them, and took them either to sell
them or to use them himself, then he took them, in the
language of the law, for the felonious purpose of converting
them to his own use; and such taking would
be larceny according to the law. But if he took them
for the purpose of carrying them to a free state, and of
thus restoring them to their natural liberty, then he did
not intend to convert them to his own use, and is not
guilty of stealing.</p>

<p>There is another view of this case. The harshest
doctrines in favor of slavery only claim, that a master
has a right to the <i>services</i> of his slave. He has not a
right to his flesh and bones, so that he can cut up the
former for dog’s meat, and grind the latter for compost.
To constitute larceny, then, of this kind of property, the
prisoner must have deprived the master of the <i>services</i>
of his slaves, with the intent, with the felonious intent,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_116">[Pg 116]</span>
to use <i>those services</i> himself, or to sell them to another,
which would be the most effective act of use. But no
evidence of any such intent has been adduced in this
case. I therefore maintain, that neither of the three
ingredients necessary to constitute the offence of larceny
has been proved by the government.</p>

<p>And now, gentlemen, in closing, I will narrate to you
the worst of the prisoner’s case. I will make confession
for him of the length and breadth of his offence. There
resides in this city a man named Daniel Bell, who was
once held as a slave, but who purchased his own freedom.
He had a family, consisting of his wife and eight
or ten children. These were manumitted by their
master, when he was brought to that most searching
of all earthly tribunals,—the death bed. After the
master’s decease, his heirs attempted to reclaim the
property; for the living and the dying have very different
views on the subject of slavery. Their ground
of claim was, that the master was not of sound and disposing
mind when he made the deed of manumission.
But the magistrate who prepared the deed, and before
whom it was executed and acknowledged, set that pretence
aside by his own knowledge of the grantor’s
sanity; and so the family of Bell passed as free, and
were treated as free, for years. At length this magistrate
died, and immediately the attempt to reduce the
family to bondage was renewed. A trial was had, and
through default of the now deceased magistrate’s testimony,
a verdict against them was obtained. But new
evidence was discovered, and one of the most respectable
counsellors of this court, Joseph H. Bradley, Esq.,
made oath as to his belief in the sufficiency of that evidence,
and moved for a new trial. It was while these
proceedings were pending, in behalf of the wife and
children, that they became alarmed lest they should be
clandestinely sent to the south, and there be plunged
into irredeemable slavery. Believing themselves free,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_117">[Pg 117]</span>
and fearing bondage, they did send to Philadelphia for
assistance, (I tell you the worst of it,) in being rescued
from such a fate. This defendant, Drayton, being led
also to believe that they were free, did come to assist
them. Drayton might have said to himself, “Men go to
assist Poles and Hungarians, and even Texans, and get
glory for it; and why should I not assist free women
and children in imminent danger of bondage?” He arrived
here on Thursday evening, the 13th of April, and,
having no other special business, prepared to sail from
here, and did so sail, on Saturday evening, the 15th.
Bell’s family knew the place where the defendant’s
vessel was anchored, and the time fixed for its departure.
Drayton, expecting to meet them there at the time appointed,
was not at his vessel during the whole evening.
But one thing happened which he did not expect, and
had not provided against. Bell’s family had a few
friends whom they thought they could take with them.
They did not propose any spoiling of the Egyptians,
but thought the escape of a few Israelites lawful. But
these friends had <i>their</i> friends, and they still another
circle; and so, while the defendant was absent from
his vessel on Saturday evening, and without his knowledge
or consent, they flocked down and stowed themselves
in the hold; so that,—and I say now, gentlemen,
what I religiously believe to be true,—when
these slaves were ordered to come on deck after the
capture, the prisoner was as much astonished as any
body at the number of fishes that had got into his net.</p>

<p>These, gentlemen, are the facts, and, as I believe,
all the important facts pertaining to this case; and on
these facts we claim that you must acquit the prisoner
of the offence of larceny.</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p><span class="smcap">Note.</span> This case and one or two others were tried, and, in consequence
of a series of most extraordinary rulings by the court, a verdict
of “<i>guilty</i>” was rendered.</p>

<p>Every lawyer knows that in the course of a trial, when counsel can<span class="pagenum" id="Page_118">[Pg 118]</span>
have no time for examination or reflection, they take exceptions,
wherever an objection to the decision of the judge seems probably, or
even plausibly good. A clew, therefore, will be given to the course
which the court pursued throughout these trials, when the fact is
stated, that, on appeal to the Superior Court, <i>seventeen</i> out of <i>twenty-four</i>
of the rulings of the judge to which exception had been taken
were set aside.</p>

<p>The cases for larceny were remanded to be tried anew, when a verdict
of “not guilty” was rendered in them all.</p>

<p>Drayton, the captain, and Sayres, his mate, were afterwards convicted
of “transporting” the slaves, and were fined.</p>

<p>English, the “boy,” though indicted in one hundred and fifteen
indictments, was discharged without a trial.</p>

<p>Part of Bell’s free family were ransomed; the rest were sold and
sent to the South.</p>

<p>Although the facts pertaining to the mob, the repeated attempts
upon Drayton’s life, the besieging of the jail, and the expulsion of
Drayton’s counsel from it when engaged in his defence, all came out
before the grand jury that found these scores and hundreds of indictments,
and though it was notorious who some of the ringleaders of
the mob were, yet no bill of indictment was ever found against any
of them.</p>

<p>I have received with lively emotions of gratitude a

held at Dedham, on the — inst.; from one of which it
appears that I was unanimously nominated by the
convention, as their candidate for the Thirty-first Congress
of the United States.</p>

<hr class="tb">

<p>The convention you have the honor to represent
was pleased to refer to my views respecting the institution

expressed in the remarks made by me in the House of
Representatives, on the 30th of June last; in the letter
to my constituents before referred to; and in my arguments
before the <i>Criminal</i> Court of the District of
Columbia, in the “Pearl” cases. These, and kindred
views, I shall improve all fitting opportunities that I
may ever enjoy to enlarge upon and enforce; and had
I the tongue of an angel, or the pen of inspiration, I
believe I could use them on no holier theme than in
kindling abhorrence at the wrongs suffered by the
slave, and in melting the universal heart of humanity
into pity for his lot; for I hold it to be impossible for
the soul of a slave,—benighted, strangled, and buried<span class="pagenum" id="Page_120">[Pg 120]</span>

of that spiritual liberty wherewith Christ maketh his

<p><span class="smcap">Delivered in the House of Representatives of the United
States, February 23, 1849, on Slavery and the
Slave Trade in the District of Columbia.</span></p>
</div>


<p>
<span class="smcap">Mr. Chairman</span>;<br>
</p>

<p>There is a bill upon the speaker’s table which provides
for abolishing the slave trade in the District of
Columbia. For three successive days we have tried in
vain to reach it, in the order of business. Its opponents
have baffled our efforts. Our difficulty is not in
carrying the bill, but in reaching it. I am not without
apprehension that the last sands of this Congress will
run out, without any action upon the subject. Even
should the bill be taken up, it is probable that all debate
upon it will be suppressed by that sovereign silencer,—the
previous question. Hence I avail myself
of the present opportunity, as it is probably the only
one I shall have, during the present session, to submit
my views upon it.</p>

<p>I frankly avow, in the outset, that the bill provides
for one part only of an evil, whose remedy, as it seems
to me, is not only the object of a reasonable desire, but
of a righteous and legal demand. The bill proposes the
abolition, not of slavery, but only of the slave trade, in
the District of Columbia. My argument will go to
show, that, within the limits of this District, slavery
ought not to exist in fact, and does not exist in law.</p>

<p>Sir, in the first place, let us inquire what is the state
of things in this District on this subject. The gentleman
from Indiana, [Mr. <span class="smcap">R. W. Thompson</span>,] who addressed
us a few days since, used the following
language:—</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_122">[Pg 122]</span></p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>“What is the slave trade in the District of Columbia? I
have heard a great deal said about ‘slave pens,’—about
slaves sold at auction,—and about stripping the mother from
the child, and the husband from the wife. These things may
exist here, but I do not know of them. Since I have been in
the habit of visiting the District,—which is from my boyhood,—I
have never seen a negro sold here,—I have never
seen a band of negroes taken off by the slave trader. I do
not remember that I have ever seen the slave trader himself.
I know nothing of the ‘slave pen’ that is so much talked
about. It may be here, however, and these things may happen
every day before the eyes of gentlemen who choose to
hunt them up; but for myself, I have no taste for such
things.”</p>
</div>

<p>Now, sir, if the gentleman means to say that he has
no personal knowledge of “slave pens” and of the
slave traffic in this District, that is one thing; but if
he means to deny or call in question the existence of
the traffic itself, or of the dens where its concentrated
iniquities make up the daily employment of men, that
is quite another thing. Sir, from the western front of
this Capitol, from the piazza that opens out from your
congressional library, as you cast your eye along the
horizon and over the conspicuous objects of the landscape,—the
President’s Mansion, the Smithsonian Institution,
and the site of the Washington Monument,
you cannot fail to see the horrid and black receptacles
where human beings are penned like cattle, and kept
like cattle, that they may be sold like cattle,—as
strictly and literally so as oxen and swine are kept and
sold at the Smithfield shambles in London, or at the
cattle fair in Brighton. In a communication made
during the last session, by the mayor of this city, to
an honorable member of this House, <i>he</i> acknowledges
the existence of slave pens here. Up and down the
beautiful river that sweeps along the western margin
of the District, slavers come and go, bearing their
freight of human souls to be vended in this market-place;<span class="pagenum" id="Page_123">[Pg 123]</span>
and after they have changed hands, according
to the forms of commerce, they are retransported,—the
father of a family to go, perhaps, to the rice fields
of South Carolina, the mother to the cotton fields of
Alabama, and the children to be scattered over the
sugar plantations of Louisiana or Texas.</p>

<p>Sir, it is notorious that the slave traders of this
District advertise for slaves in the newspapers of the
neighboring counties of Maryland, to be delivered in
any numbers at their slave pens in this city; and that
they have agents, in the city and out of it, who are
engaged in supplying victims for their shambles. Since
the gentleman from Indiana was elected to this Congress,
and, I believe, since he took his seat in this
Congress, one coffle of about sixty slaves came, chained
and driven, into this city; and at about the same time
another coffle of a hundred. Here they were lodged
for a short period, were then sold, and went on their
returnless way to the ingulfing south.</p>

<p>Sir, all this is done here under our own eyes, and
within hearing of our own ears. All this is done now,
and it has been done for fifty years,—ever since the
seat of the national government was established in
this place, and ever since Congress, in accordance with
the constitution, has exercised “<i>exclusive</i> legislation”
over it. But the gentleman from Indiana, though accustomed
to visit this District from his boyhood, has
“never seen a negro sold here;”—he has “never
seen a band of negroes taken off by the slave trader;”
he does not remember “to have seen the slave
trader himself;” he knows “nothing of the ‘slave pen’
that is so much talked about.” Sir, the eye sees, not
less from the inner than from the outer light. The
eye sees what the mind is disposed to recognize. The
image upon the retina is nothing, if there be not an
inward sense to discern it. The artist sees beauty;
the philosopher sees relations of cause and effect; the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_124">[Pg 124]</span>
benevolent man catches the slightest tone of sorrow;
but the insensate heart can wade through tears and see
no weeping, and can live amidst groans of anguish,
and the air will be a non-conductor of the sound. I
know a true anecdote of an American gentleman who
walked through the streets of London with a British
nobleman; and being beset at every step of the way
by squalid mendicants, the American, at the end of
the excursion, adverted to their having run a gantlet
between beggars. “What beggars?” said his lordship;
“<i>I have seen none</i>.”</p>

<p>But the gentleman from Indiana says, “But for myself,
I have no taste for such things.” His taste explains
his vision. Suppose Wilberforce and Clarkson
to have had no “taste” for quelling the horrors of the
African slave trade. Suppose Howard and Mrs. Fry
to have had no “taste” for laying open the abominations
of the prison-house, and for giving relief to the
prisoner. Suppose Miss Dix to have had no “taste”
for carrying solace and comfort and restoration to the
insane. Suppose the Abbé L’Epée to have had no
“taste” for teaching deaf mutes; or the Abbé Hauy
for educating the blind; or M. Seguin and others for
training idiots, and for educing docility and decency,
and a love of order from those almost imperceptible
germs of reason and sense, that barely distinguish them
from the brutes! Suppose these things, and in what
a different condition would the charities and the sufferings
of the world have been! Herod had no “taste”
for sparing the lives of the children of Bethlehem, and
of all the coasts thereof; and doubtless he could have
said, with entire truth, that he never heard the voice,
in Rama, of lamentation and weeping and great mourning;
nor saw, among all the mothers of Syria, any
Rachel weeping for her children and refusing to be
comforted, because they were not. But, sir, just in
proportion as the light of civilization and Christianity<span class="pagenum" id="Page_125">[Pg 125]</span>
dawns upon the world, will men be found who have a
“taste” for succoring the afflicted and for righting the
wronged. It was the clearest proof of the Great
Teacher’s mission, that he had “a taste” for going
about doing good.</p>

<p>During the last fifty years, and especially during the
last half of these fifty years, the world has made great
advances in the principles of liberty. Human rights
have been recognized, and their practical enjoyment, to
some extent, secured. There is not a government in
Europe, even the most iron and despotical of them all,
that has not participated in the ameliorations which
characterize the present age. A noble catalogue of
rights has been wrested by the British commons from
the British nobility. France and Italy have been revolutionized.
Even the Pope of Rome, whose power
seemed as eternal as the hills on which he was seated,
has sunk under the shock. Prussia, and all the Germanic
powers, with the exception of Austria, have
been half revolutionized; and even the icy despotisms
of Austria and Russia are forced to relent under those
central fires of liberty which burn forever in the
human heart, as the central fires of the earth burn
forever at its core. Great Britain has abolished African
slavery throughout all her realms. France has declared
that any one who shall voluntarily become the
owner of a slave, or shall voluntarily continue to be
the owner of a slave cast upon him by bequest or inheritance,
shall cease to be a citizen of France. Denmark
has abolished slavery wherever it existed in her
possessions. The Bey of Tunis, acting under the
light of the Mahometan religion, has abolished it. The
priests of Persia declare the sentiment to have come by
tradition from Mahomet himself, “that the worst of
men is the seller of men.” Not only all civilized nations,
but the half civilized, the semi-barbarous, are
acting under the guidance of the clearer light and the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_126">[Pg 126]</span>
higher motives of our day. But there is one conspicuous
exception; there is one government which closes
its eyes to this increasing light; which resists the persuasion
of these ennobling motives; which, on the
grand subject of human liberty and human rights, is
stationary and even retrogrades, while the whole world
around is advancing; sleeps while all others are
awaking; loves its darkness while all others are aspiring
and ascending to a purer air and a brighter sky.
This government, too, is the one which is most boastful
and vain-glorious of its freedom; and if the humiliating
truth must be spoken, this government is our
own. In regard to slavery and the slave trade in this
District, where we possess the power of exclusive legislation,
we stand where we stood fifty years ago. Not
a single ameliorating law has been passed. In practice,
we are where we were then; in spirit, there are proofs
that we have gone backward.</p>

<p>There are now on the surface of the globe two conspicuous
places,—places which are attracting the gaze
of the whole civilized world,—whither men and women
are brought from great distances to be sold, and whence
they are carried to great distances to suffer the heaviest
wrongs that human nature can bear. One of these
places is the coast of Africa, which is among the most
pagan and benighted regions of the earth; the other is
the District of Columbia, the capital and seat of government
of the United States.</p>

<p>As far back as 1808, Congress did what it could to
abolish the slave trade on the coast of Africa. In 1820
it declared the foreign slave trade to be piracy; but on
the 31st of January, 1849, a bill was introduced into
this House to abolish the domestic slave trade in this
District,—here, in the centre and heart of the nation,—and
seventy-two representatives voted against it,—voted
to lay it on the table, where, as we all know, it
would sleep a dreamless sleep. This was in the House<span class="pagenum" id="Page_127">[Pg 127]</span>
of Representatives. It is well known that the Senate
is still more resistant of progress than the House; and
it is the opinion of many that, even if a bill should
pass both House and Senate, it would receive the Executive
veto. By authority of Congress, the city of
Washington is the Congo of America.</p>

<p>But, still more degrading than this, there is another
contrast which we present to the whole civilized
world. The very slaves upon whom we have trodden
have risen above us, and their moral superiority makes
our conduct ignominious. Not Europeans only, not
only Arabians and Turks, are emerging from the inhumanity
and the enormities of the slave traffic; but even
our own slaves, transplanted to the land of their fathers,
are raising barriers against the spread of this execrable
commerce. On the shores of Africa, a republic is
springing up, whose inhabitants were transplanted from
this Egypt of bondage. And now, look at the government
which these slaves and descendants of slaves
have established, and contrast it with our own. They
discard the institution of slavery, while we cherish it.
A far greater proportion of their children than of the
white children of the slave states of this Union are at
school. In the metropolis of their nation, their flag
does not protect the slave traffic, nor wave over the
slave mart. Would to God that the very opposite of
this were not true of our own! Their laws punish
the merchandise of human beings; our laws sanction
and encourage it. They have erected, and are erecting,
fortifications and military posts along the shores of
the Atlantic, for seven hundred miles, to prevent pirates
from invading the domain of their neighbors, and kidnapping
people who, to them, are foreign nations. We
open market-places here, at the centre of the nation,
where, from seven hundred miles of coast, the sellers
may come to sell, and where buyers may come to buy,
and whence slaves are carried almost as far from their<span class="pagenum" id="Page_128">[Pg 128]</span>
birthplace as Africa is from America. The governor
of Liberia has lately made a voyage to England and
France, and entered into treaties of amity and commerce
with them; and he has obtained naval forces
from them, to abolish this traffic in human beings. At
the same time, we are affording guaranties to the same
traffic. Virginia and Maryland are to the slave trade
what the interior of Africa once was. The Potomac
and the Chesapeake are the American Niger and Bight
of Benin; while this District is the great government
barracoon, whence coffles are driven across the country
to Alabama or Texas, as slave ships once bore their
dreadful cargoes of agony and woe across the Atlantic.
The very race, then, which were first stolen, brought
to this country, despoiled of all the rights which God
had given them, and kept in bondage for generations,
at last, after redeeming themselves, or being restored
to their natural liberty in some other way, have crossed
the ocean, established a government for themselves,
and are now setting us an example which should cause
our cheeks to blister with shame.</p>

<p>Sir, there is an idea often introduced here and elsewhere,
and made to bear against any restriction of slavery,
or any amelioration of the condition of the slave,
which I wish to consider. It was brought odiously
and prominently forward the other day, by the gentleman
from Pennsylvania, [Mr. <span class="smcap">Charles Brown</span>.] The
idea is, that the slaves are in a better condition in this
country than they would have been at home. It is
affirmed that they are brought under some degree of
civilizing and humanizing influences amongst us, which
they would not have felt in the land of their fathers.</p>

<p>Let us look, first, at the philosophy of this notion,
and then at its morality. All those who use this argument
as a defence or a mitigation of the evils of slavery,
or as a <i>final cause</i> for its existence, <i>assume</i> that
if the present three million slaves, who now darken<span class="pagenum" id="Page_129">[Pg 129]</span>
our southern horizon, and fill the air with their groans,
had not been here in their present state of bondage,
they would have been in Africa, in a state of paganism.
Now, the slightest reflection shows that this assumption
has no basis of truth. Not one of them all
would now have been in existence, if their ancestors
had not been brought to this country. And, according
to the laws of population operative among barbarous
nations, there are now just as many inhabitants,—pagans,
cannibals, or what you please,—in Africa, as
there would have been if the spoiler had never entered
their home, and ravished and borne them into bondage.
Among savage nations, or nomadic tribes, the population
equals the means of subsistence. Take away
two, three, or four per cent. of the consumers, and
the vacuum is immediately filled. The population
keeps up to the level of the production. Among such
people, there is always a tendency to increase faster
than the means of living increase. Take away a part
of them, and this tendency to increase takes effect by
its own vigor,—it executes itself. It is like a bow
that unbends, or a spring that uncoils, as soon as an
external pressure is removed. Dam up a fountain, and
the weight of the accumulating strata will eventually
check the outflow from the spring. So it is of a savage
population. Of them, the Malthusian theory is true.</p>

<p>And how infinitely absurd and ridiculous is the plea
that the slaves are better off here “<i>than</i> <span class="allsmcap">THEY</span> <i>would
have been in Africa</i>”! Go out into the streets of this
city, and take the first one you meet,—perhaps he is
a mulatto. But for being here, he would have been a
mulatto in the middle of Africa, would he? Take
them all,—mulatto, mestizo, zambo, and all “the vast
variety of man,” so far as color is concerned,—and if
they had not their existence here, they would have had
it in Africa! This is the doctrine. Would they have
had the same American names also? Would they<span class="pagenum" id="Page_130">[Pg 130]</span>
have spoken the same language, and worn cotton
grown on the same fields? The last is just as certain
as the first. It is all more silly than the repinings of
the silly girls who grieved because their mother had
not married a certain rich suitor, whose addresses in
early life she had rejected; for then, said they, how
rich <i>we</i> should have been! No, not one of these three
millions of men, women, and children, would have
been in existence in Africa. All the crime of their
kidnapping; all the horrors of the middle passage; all
their sufferings for two centuries, or six generations;
and all the calamities that are yet to grow out of their
condition,—all these crimes and agonies are gratuitous
crimes and agonies. There is no recompense or palliation
for them. They have been added unnecessarily
and remorselessly to the amount of human guilt and
suffering for which the white race must answer in the
day of account. The idea, then, of sending the slaves
back to <i>their</i> country is an egregious fallacy. If they
were to be sent <i>back</i> whence they came, it would not
be to Africa, but to nonentity.</p>

<p>If the ancestors of the present three millions of
slaves had never been brought here,—if their descendants
had never been propagated here, for the supposed
value of their services, their places would have been
supplied by white laborers,—by men of the Caucasian
race,—by freemen. Instead of the three million
slaves, of all colors, we should doubtless now have at
least three million white, freeborn citizens, adding to
the real prosperity of the country, and to the power
of the Republic. If the south had not had slaves to
do their work for them, they would have become ingenious
and inventive like the north, and would have
enlisted the vast forces of nature in their service,—wind,
and fire, and water, and steam, and lightning, the
mighty energies of gravitation and the subtle forces of
chemistry. The country might not have had so gaudy<span class="pagenum" id="Page_131">[Pg 131]</span>
and ostentatious a civilization as at present, but it
would have had one infinitely more pure and sound.</p>

<p>But admit the alleged statement, absurd and false as it
is; admit that these three millions of slaves would have
belonged to Africa if they had not belonged to America,—that
they would have been born of the same fathers
and mothers there as here, so that those of them who
are American mulattoes would have been Ethiopian
mulattoes; and admit, further, that their present condition
is better than the alternative condition alleged,—and
what then? Is your duty done? Is it enough
if you have made the condition of a man or of a race a
little better, or any better, if you have not made it as
much better as you can? What standard of morals do
gentlemen propose to themselves? If a fellow-being is
suffering under a hundred diseases, and we can relieve
him from them all, what kind of benevolence is that
which boasts of relieving him from one, and permits
him to suffer under the other ninety and nine? By
the law of nature and of God, the slave, like every
other man, is entitled “to life, liberty, and the pursuit
of happiness;” he is entitled to his earnings,—to the
enjoyment of his social affections,—to the development
of his intellectual and moral faculties,—to that
cultivation of his religious nature which shall fit him,
not merely to feel, but reason of righteousness, temperance,
and a judgment to come;—he is entitled to
all these rights, of which he has been cruelly despoiled;
and when he catches some feeble glimmering of some
of them, we withhold the rest, and defend ourselves
and pride ourselves that he is better off than he would
have been in some other country or in some other condition.
Suppose the Samaritan had bound up a single
wound, or relieved a single pang of the bleeding wayfarer
who had fallen among thieves, and then had gone
to the next inn and boasted of his benevolence. He
would only have shown the difference between a<span class="pagenum" id="Page_132">[Pg 132]</span>
“good Samaritan” and a “bigot Samaritan.” The
thieves themselves might have done as much.</p>

<p>But there is another inquiry which the champions
of slavery have got to answer before the world and
before Heaven. If American slaves are better off than
native Africans, who is to be thanked for it? Has their
improved condition resulted from any purposed plan,
any well-digested, systematized measure, carefully
thought out, and reasoned out, and intended for their
benefit? Not at all. In all the southern statute books,
and legislative records, there is no trace of any such
scheme. Laws, judicial decisions, the writing of political
economists,—all treat the slave as a thing to
make money with. Agricultural societies give rewards
for the best crops. Horse-jockey societies improve the
fleetness of the breed for the sports of the turf. Even
the dogs have professional trainers. But not one thing
is done to bring out the qualities of manhood that lie
buried in a slave. Look through the southern statute
books, and see what Draconian penalties are inflicted
for teaching a slave to read,—see how he is lashed for
attending a meeting to hear the Word of God. On
every highroad patrols lie in wait to scourge him back
if he attempts to visit father, mother, wife, child, or
friend, on a neighboring plantation. By day and by
night, at all times and every where, he is the victim of
an energetic and comprehensive system of measures,
which blot out his senses, paralyze his mind, degrade
and brutify his nature, and suppress the instinctive
workings of truth, generosity, and manhood in his
breast. All the good that reaches him, reaches him in
defiance of these privations and disabilities. If any
light penetrates to his soul, it is because human art
cannot weave a cloud dense and dark enough to be
wholly impervious to it. There are some blessings
which the goodness of God will bestow in spite of human
efforts to intercept them. It is these only which<span class="pagenum" id="Page_133">[Pg 133]</span>
reach the slave. And after having built up all barriers
to forbid the access of improvement; after having
sealed his senses by ignorance, and more than half obliterated
his faculties by neglect and perversion, the
oppressor turns round, and because there are some
scanty, incidental benefits growing out of the very deplorableness
of his condition, he justifies himself before
the world, and claims the approval of Heaven, because
the slave is better off here than <i>he</i> would be in Africa.
Sir, such an argument as this is an offence to Heaven.
I consider it to be as much worse than atheism as
Christianity is better. And when such an argument
comes from a gentleman belonging to a free state;
when it comes from the gentleman from Pennsylvania,
[Mr. <span class="smcap">Brown</span>,] from a representative of the city of
William Penn; when he, without motive, without inducement,
offers such a gratuity to the devil, I can account
for it only on the principle of the man who,
having a keen relish for the flesh of swine, said he
wished he were a Jew, that he might have the pleasure
of eating pork and committing a sin at the same time.</p>

<p>But the subject presents a still more painful aspect.
How are slaves made better, and from what motives
are they made better, in this country? It is no secret
that I am about to tell. There are certain virtues and
sanctities which increase the pecuniary value of certain
slaves; and there are certain vices and debasements
which increase the market price of others. If a master
wishes to repose personal confidence in his slave, he
desires to have him honest and faithful to truth. But
if he desires to make use of him to deceive and cajole
and defraud, then he wishes to make him cunning and
tricky and false. If the master trains the slave to take
care of his own children, or of his favorite animals,
then he wishes to have him kind; but if he trains him
for a tasker or a field overseer, then he wishes to have
him severe. Now, it is in this way that some of the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_134">[Pg 134]</span>
Christian attributes of character, being directly convertible
into money or money’s worth, enhance the
value of a slave. Hence, it is said in advertisements
that a slave is pious, and, at the auction block, the
hardened and heartless seller dwells upon the Christian
graces and religious character of some slaves with the
unction of an apostle. The purchaser sympathizes,
and only desires to know whether the article be a real
or a sham Christian. If mere bones and muscles compacted
into human shape be worth five hundred dollars,
then, if the auctioneer can warrant the subject to have
the meekness of Moses and the patience of Job, the
same article may be worth seven hundred. If the
slave will forgive injuries, not merely seventy times
seven, but injuries inflicted all his life long, then an
additional hundred may be bid for him. If he possesses
all the attributes of religion and piety, the endurance
of a hero, the constancy of a saint, the firmness
of a martyr, the trustingness of a disciple,—all
except those which go to make him feel like a man,
and believe himself a man,—then that which as mere
bone and muscle was worth five hundred dollars, is
now worth a thousand. Sir, is not this selling the
Holy Spirit? Is not this making merchandise of the
Savior? Is not this the case of Judas selling his Master
over again, with the important exception of the remorse
that made the original culprit go and hang himself?
But suppose the case to be that of a woman; suppose
her ability to work and capacity for production to be
worth five hundred dollars; suppose, in addition to
this, she is young and sprightly and voluptuous; suppose
the repeated infusion of Saxon blood has almost
washed the darkness from her skin; and suppose she
is not unwilling to submit herself to the libertine’s embrace;
then, too, that which before was worth but five
hundred dollars, will now bring two thousand. And
thus infernal as well as celestial qualities are coined<span class="pagenum" id="Page_135">[Pg 135]</span>
into money, according to the demands of the market
and the uses of the purchaser.</p>

<p>Now, it is only in some such incidental way, and
with regard to some individuals, that it can be said,
that their condition is better here than it would be in
Africa. And this improvement, where it exists, is not
the result of any system of measures designed for their
benefit, but is the product of selfish motives, turning
godliness into gain; and where more gain or more
gratification can be obtained by the debasement, the
irreligion, the pollution of the slave, there the instincts
of chastity, the sanctity of the marriage relation, the
holiness of maternal love are all profaned to give security
and zest to the guilty pleasures of the sensualist
and debauchee. There are individual exceptions to
what I have said,—exceptions which, amid surrounding
iniquity, shine “like a jewel in an Ethiop’s ear,”
but they are exceptions. Laws, institutions, and the
prevailing public sentiment are as I have described.</p>

<p>I regard the argument, therefore, of the gentleman
from Pennsylvania, [Mr. <span class="smcap">Brown</span>,] not only as utterly
unsound and false in its premises, but as blasphemous
in its conclusions. Common blasphemy seldom reaches
beyond exclamation. It is some fiery outburst of
impious passion, that flashes and expires. But the gentleman
reasons it out coolly. His is argumentative
blasphemy, borrowing the forms of logic that it may
appear to have its force, and transferring it from the
passions to the intellect, to give it permanency.</p>

<p>But the gentleman from Pennsylvania retorts upon
Massachusetts, and refers to certain things in her history
which he regards as disreputable to her. In this
he has been followed by the gentleman from Virginia,
[Mr. <span class="smcap">Bedinger</span>,] who has poured out a torrent of abuse
upon my native state, and who has attempted to fortify
his own intemperate accusations from a pro-slavery
pamphlet which has been profusely scattered about this<span class="pagenum" id="Page_136">[Pg 136]</span>
House within a few days past, and which is not merely
full of falsehoods, but is composed of falsehoods; so
that if one were to take the false assertions and the false
arguments out of it, there would be nothing but the
covers left.<a id="FNanchor_5" href="#Footnote_5" class="fnanchor">[5]</a> Sir, I am very far from arrogating for
Massachusetts all the merits and the virtues which she
ought to possess. I mourn over her errors, and would
die to reform, rather than spend one breath to defend
them. The recital of her offences can fall more sadly
upon no ear than upon my own. But it is as true of a
state as of an individual, that repentance is the first
step towards reformation. Massachusetts has committed
errors; but when they were seen to be errors, she
discarded them. She once held slaves; but when she
saw that slavery was contrary to the rights of man and
the law of God, she emancipated them. She was the
first government in the civilized world,—in the whole
world, ancient or modern,—to abolish slavery, wherever
she had power to do so. This is an honor that
no rival can ever snatch from her brow. Once,—I
say it with humiliation,—she was engaged in the slave
trade. But all the gold that could be earned by the
accursed traffic, though spent in the splendors of luxury
and the seductions of hospitality, could not save the
trader himself from infamy and scorn; and I am sure I
am right in saying that the slave trade ceased to be
conducted by Massachusetts merchants, and to be carried
on in Massachusetts ships, from Massachusetts
ports, before it was abandoned by the merchants and
discontinued in the ships and from the ports of any
other commercial state or nation in the world. This,
too, is an honor, which it will be hers, through all the
immortality of the ages, alone to wear. But Massachusetts,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_137">[Pg 137]</span>
it is still said, has her idolaters of Mammon in
other forms. It is charged upon her that many of her
children still wallow in the sty of intemperance; that
her spiritualism runs wild in religious vagaries; and
that something of the old leaven of persecution still
clings to her heart. In vindicating what is right, I
will not defend what is wrong. I cannot deny,—would
to God that I could,—that we still have vices
and vicious men amongst us. There are those there,
as elsewhere, who, if they were to hear for the first
time of the River of Life flowing fast by the throne
of God, would instinctively ask whether there were
any good mill sites on it. There are those there, as
elsewhere, whose highest aspirations for heaven and
for happiness, whether for this life or for another, are
a distillery and a sugar-house, with steam machinery
to mix the products. There, as elsewhere, there are
religionists who are quick to imitate the Savior when
he strikes, but despise his example when he heals.</p>

<p>But, sir, let me say this for Massachusetts, that whatever
sins she may have committed in former times,—whatever
dissenters she may have persecuted, or
witches she may have hanged, or Africans she may
have stolen and sold,—she has long since abandoned
these offences, and is bringing forth fruits meet for repentance.
And is a state to have no benefit from a
statute of limitations? Is a crime committed by ancestors
to be forever imputed to their posterity? This
is worse than non-forgiveness; it is making punishment
hereditary. Sir, of these offences, Massachusetts has
repented and reformed; and she is giving that noblest
of atonements or expiations, which consists in repairing
the wrong that has been done; and where the victim
of the wrong has himself passed away, and is beyond
relief, then in paying, with large interest, the debt to
humanity which the special creditor is no longer present
to receive, by seeking out the objects of want and<span class="pagenum" id="Page_138">[Pg 138]</span>
suffering wherever they may be found. Sir, our accusers
unconsciously do us the highest honor, when, in
their zeal to malign us, they seek for historical reproaches.
If they could find present offences wherewith
to upbraid us, they would not exhume the past.
But they condemn themselves, for they show that even
the resuscitation of the errors of the dead gives them
more pleasure than a contemplation of the virtues of
the living. One thing is certain: the moment the other
states shall imitate our present example, they will cease
to condemn us for our past offences. The sympathy
of a common desire for improvement will destroy the
pleasure of crimination.</p>

<p>And where, I ask, on the surface of the earth, is
there a population of only eight hundred thousand,
who are striving so earnestly, and doing so much, to
advance the cause of humanity and civilization, as is
doing by the people of Massachusetts? Where else,
where universal suffrage is allowed, is a million of dollars
voted every year, by the very men who have to
pay it, for the public, free education of every child in
the state?</p>

<p>Where else, by such a limited population, is another
million of dollars voluntarily voted and paid each year
for the salaries of clergymen alone? Where else,
where the population is so small, and natural resources
so few and scanty, is still another million of dollars annually
given in charity?—the greater portion of which
is sent beyond their own borders, flows into every
state in the Union, and leaves not a nation on the
globe, nor an island in the sea, unwatered by its fertilizing
streams. Look into the statute book of Massachusetts,
for the last twenty years, and you will see
how the whole current of her legislation has set in the
direction of human improvement,—for succoring disease
or restoration from it, for supplying the privations
of nature, for reclaiming the vicious, for elevating all,—a<span class="pagenum" id="Page_139">[Pg 139]</span>
comprehensiveness of scope that takes in every
human being, and an energy of action that follows
every individual with a blessing to his home. When
others will abandon their offences, then let the remembrance
of them be blotted out.</p>

<p>But, sir, I think it proper to advert to the fact that
I have had other proofs, during the present session of
Congress, of the same spirit of crimination and obloquy
which was so fully developed in the speeches of
the gentleman from Pennsylvania, [Mr. <span class="smcap">Brown</span>,] and
the gentleman from Virginia, [Mr. <span class="smcap">Bedinger</span>.] Through
the post-office of the House of Representatives, I have
been in the regular receipt of anonymous letters, made
up mainly of small slips cut from newspapers printed
at the north, describing some case of murder, suicide,
robbery, or other offence. These have been arranged
under the heads of different states,—Ohio, Pennsylvania,
New York, Connecticut, &amp;c., and accompanied,
in the margin, with rude drawings of a school-book or
a school house, and all referred to Common Schools, as
to their source. Two only, of the whole number thus
collected, originated in Massachusetts, and one of these
was a case of suicide committed by a man who had
become insane from the loss of his wife. Which of
these events, in the opinion of my anonymous correspondent,
constituted the crime,—whether the bereavement
that caused the insanity, or the suicide committed
in one of its paroxysms,—I am unable to say.
Now, what satisfaction even a bad man could have in
referring offences against law and morality to the institution
of public schools, when he must have known
that the very existence of the offences only proves that
education has not yet done its perfect work, I cannot
conceive. And what spite, either against an educational
office which I once held, or against an institution
which is worthy of all honor, could be so mean and
paltry as to derive gratification from referring me to<span class="pagenum" id="Page_140">[Pg 140]</span>
long lists of offences, only one of which was committed
in my native state, I must leave for others to conjecture.
Surely the author of these letters must have
known little of Common Schools, and profited by them
as little as he has known. Had he referred to any
considerable number of crimes perpetrated in Massachusetts,
I would take his letters home and carry them
into our public schools, and make them the text for a
sermon, in which I would warn the children to beware
of all crimes, and especially of the meanness and the
wickedness which feels a complacency in the crimes
of others, or can give a false paternity to them. And,
sir, I should be sure of a response; for out of those
schools there is going forth a nobler band of young
men and women than ever before conferred intelligence,
virtue, refinement, and renown upon any people
or community on the face of the globe.</p>

<p>But whatever may be said in mitigation or in condemnation
of slavery elsewhere, there are special
reasons why it should be discontinued in this District.
This District is the common property of the nation.
Having power of exclusive legislation over it, we are
all responsible for the institutions in it. While slaves
exist in it, therefore, it can be charged upon the north
that they uphold slavery. This is unjust to us, because
it places us before the world in the attitude of
sustaining what we condemn. It wounds our moral
and religious sensibilities, because we believe the institution
to be cruel towards men, and sinful in the
sight of Heaven; and yet we are made apparently to
sanction it. It is like that species of injustice where
a man is compelled by a tax to support a religion which
he disbelieves, and to pay a hierarchy whom his conscience
compels him to denounce. But the existence
of slavery here is not necessary to the faith or the
practice of our southern brethren. If they believe it
to be a useful and justifiable institution, then they<span class="pagenum" id="Page_141">[Pg 141]</span>
evince the sincerity of that belief by sustaining and
perpetuating it at home. For this purpose, there is no
necessity of a crusade to propagate it, or sustain it
elsewhere.</p>

<p>Look at the relation which we bear to it, in another
respect. I have been taught from my earliest childhood
that “all men are created equal.” This has become
in me not merely a conviction of the understanding,
but a sentiment of the heart. This maxim
is my principle of action, whenever I am called upon
to act; and it rises spontaneously to my contemplations
when I speculate upon human duty. It is the
plainest corollary from the doctrine of the natural
equality of man, that when I see a man, or a class of
men, who are not equal to myself in opportunities, in
gifts, in means of improvement, or in motives and incitements
to an elevated character and an exemplary
life,—I say, it is the plainest corollary that I should
desire to elevate those men to an equality with myself.
However far my own life may fall below the standard
of Christianity and gentlemanliness, yet I hold it to be
clear, that no man is a Christian or a gentleman, who
does not carry about an habitual frame of mind which
prompts him, as far as he has the means to do it, to instruct
all the ignorance, to relieve all the privations, to
minister to all the pains, and to supply all the deficiencies
of those with whom he meets in the daily walks
of life; and, so far as he is a man who wields influence,
possesses authority, or exercises legislative power,
he is bound to exert his gifts and his prerogatives for
the amelioration and the improvement of his fellow-men.
This is the lowest standard of duty that any
one who aspires to be a Christian or a gentleman can
set up for his guidance. Now take the case of a man
from the north, who has incorporated these views, or
any similitude of these views, into his character, and
who has occasion to visit this District. Suppose him<span class="pagenum" id="Page_142">[Pg 142]</span>
to be elected and sent here as a member of Congress,
or to be appointed to a post in some of the departments,
or to visit this city on public business, or to
come here from motives of curiosity; what is the sight
which is inflicted upon him when he first sets his foot
within this common property of the nation,—when
he first enters this household, where the head of the
nation resides and directs? Sir, when he first alights
from the cars that bring him within your limits and
your jurisdiction, he beholds a degraded caste,—a
race of men whom God endowed with the faculties of
intelligence, but whom man has despoiled of the power
of improving those faculties, squalid in their garb, betraying
ignorance in every word they utter, uncultivated
in their manners and their tastes, fawning for a
favor, instead of standing erect like men who are conscious
of rights; or, if they have outgrown servile
and sycophantic habits, then erring on the side of impudence
and insolence as much as they erred before
on that of cringing and servility. He repairs to his
lodgings, and there, too, all his moral sensibilities
are shocked and outraged, by seeing a class of men
and women hopelessly degraded, cut off by law and
custom from all opportunity of emerging from their
debasement; whom no talent, taste, or virtue can ever
redeem to the pleasures and the rights of social intercourse.
He sees men and women who are not degraded
on account of the services they perform,—for
“honor and shame from no condition rise,”—but degraded
by the motive and spirit from which the services
are performed; men and women who have no inducements
to industry and frugality, for their earnings will
all be seized by another; who have no incentives to
self-respect, for they can never emerge from their menial
condition; who are bereaved of all the wonders
and glories of knowledge, lest under its expansions
their natures should burst the thraldom that enslaves<span class="pagenum" id="Page_143">[Pg 143]</span>
them; and all whose manly qualities, all whose higher
faculties, therefore, are irredeemably and hopelessly
crushed, extinguished, obliterated, so that nothing but
the animal, which the master can use for his selfish
purposes, remains.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Brodhead</span>, [of Pennsylvania.] Would you advance
the slaves to an equal social and political condition
with the white race?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Mann</span>. I would give to every human being the
best opportunity I could to develop and cultivate the
faculties which God has bestowed upon him, and
which, therefore, he holds under a divine charter. I
would take from his neck the heel that has trodden him
down; I would dispel from his mind the cloud that
has shrouded him in moral night; I would remove the
obstructions that have forbidden his soul to aspire; and
having done this, I would leave him, as I would leave
every other man, to find his level,—to occupy the position
to which he should be entitled by his intelligence
and his virtues. I entertain no fears on the much
dreaded subject of amalgamation. Legal amalgamation
between the races will never take place, unless, in
the changed condition of society, reasons shall exist to
warrant and sanction it; and, in that case, it will carry
its own justification with it. But one thing I could
never understand,—why those who are so horror-stricken
at the idea of <i>theoretic</i> amalgamation, should
exhibit to the world, in all their cities, on all their
plantations, and in all their households, such numberless
proofs of <i>practical</i> amalgamation. I never could
see why those who arraign and condemn us at the
north so vehemently, because, as they say, we obtrude
our prying eyes into what they call a “domestic”
or “fireside” institution, should have no hesitation
in exhibiting to the world, through all their borders,
ten thousand, and ten times ten thousand, living
witnesses, that they make it a bedside institution.<span class="pagenum" id="Page_144">[Pg 144]</span>
Multitudes of the slaves of the south bear about upon
their persons a brand as indelible as that of Cain; but
the mark has been fastened upon them, not for their
own crimes, but for the crimes of their fathers. In
the complexion of the slave, we read the horrid history
of the guilt of the enslavers. They demonstrate that
the one race has been to the other, not the object of
benevolence, but the victim of licentiousness.</p>

<p>But to resume. When the visitor to this city from
the north leaves his lodgings, and goes into the public
streets, half the people whom he meets there are of
the same degraded class. Their tattered dress and
unseemly manners denote congenital debasement.
Their language proclaims their ignorance. If you
have occasion to send them on an errand, they cannot
read the direction of a note, or a sign on a shopboard.
Their ideas are limited within the narrowest range.
They speak the natural language of servility, and they
wear the livery of an inferior condition. The conviction
of their deplorable state is perpetually forced upon
the mind. You do not need their color to remind
you of their degradation. Color, sir! They are oftentimes
almost as white as ourselves. Sir, there is not
a member of Congress who has not frequently seen
some of his fellow-members, in the spring of the
year, with a jaundiced skin more sallow and more
yellow than that of many a slave who is bought and
sold and owned in this city. I have seen members of
this House to whom I have been disposed to give a
friendly caution to keep their “free papers” about
their persons, lest suddenly, on the presumption from
color, they should be seized and sold for runaway
slaves. A yellow complexion here is so common a
badge of slavery, that one whose skin is colored by
disease is by no means out of danger. To enjoy
security, a man must do more than take care of his
life; he must take care of his health. It is not enough<span class="pagenum" id="Page_145">[Pg 145]</span>
to take heed to the meditations of his heart; he must
see also to the secretions of his liver.</p>

<p>But, sir, the stranger from the north visits the courts
of justice in this city; he goes into halls set apart and
consecrated, even in the dark and half-heathenish
periods of English history, to the investigation of
truth and the administration of justice; but if he sees
any specimens of the colored race there, he sees them
only as menials. They cannot go there as witnesses.
However atrocious the wrongs they may suffer in their
own person and character, or in the person and character
of wife or children, they cannot appeal to the
courts to avenge or redress them. If introduced there
at all, it is as a bale of goods is introduced, or as an
ox or a horse is brought within their purlieus, for the
purpose of trying some disputed question of identity
or ownership. They go not as suitors, but as sacrifices.
In the courts of law; in the temples with
which all our ideas of justice, of right between man
and man, are associated; where truth goes to be vindicated,
where innocence flies to be avenged,—in
these courts, an entire portion of the human race are
known, not as men, but as chattels, as cattle. Where,
for them, is the Magna Charta that the old barons
wrested from King John? Is a whole race to be
forever doomed to this outlawry? Are they forever
to wear a “wolf’s head,” which every white man may
cut off when he pleases? Sir, it cannot be that this
state of things will last forever. If all the rights of
the black race are thus withheld from them, it is just
as certain as the progress of time that they, too, will
have their Runnymede, their Declaration of Independence,
their Bunker Hill, and their Yorktown.</p>

<p>Such, sir, are the sights that molest us when we
come here from the north,—that molest us in the
hotels, that molest us in the streets, that molest us in
the courts, that molest us every where. But the week<span class="pagenum" id="Page_146">[Pg 146]</span>
passes away, and the Sabbath comes,—the day of
rest from worldly toils, the day set apart for social
worship, when men come together, and, by their mutual
presence and assistance, lift up the hearts of each
other in gratitude to God. But where now are the
colored population, that seemed to be so numerous
every where else? Have they no God? Have they
no interest in the Savior’s example and precepts?
Have they no need of consolation, of faith in the
Unseen, to help them bear up under the burdens and
anxieties of life? Is their futurity so uncertain or so
worthless that they need no guide to a better country,
or that they can be turned off with a guide as ignorant
and blind as themselves?</p>

<p>We go from the courts and the churches to the
schools. But no child in whose skin there is a shadow
of a shade of African complexion is to be found there.
The channels are so cut that all the sacred and healing
waters of knowledge flow, not to him, but by
him. Sir, of all the remorseless and wanton cruelties
ever committed in this world of wickedness and
woe, I hold that to be the most remorseless and wanton
which shuts out from all the means of instruction
a being whom God has endued with the capacities of
knowledge, and inspired with the divine desire <i>to
know</i>. Strike blossom and beauty from the vernal
season of the year, and leave it sombre and cheerless;
annihilate the harmonies with which the birds of
spring make vocal the field and the forest, and let
exulting Nature become silent and desolate; dry up
even those fountains of joy and gladsomeness that
flow unbidden from the heart of childhood, and let
the radiant countenance of youth become dull and
stony like that of age;—do all this, if you will, but
withhold your profane hand from those creative sources
of knowledge which shall give ever-renewing and
ever-increasing delight through all the cycles of immortality,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_147">[Pg 147]</span>
and which have the power to assimilate the
finite creature more and more nearly to the infinite
Creator. Sir, he who denies to children the acquisition
of knowledge works devilish miracles. If a man
destroys my power of hearing, it is precisely the same
to me as though, leaving my faculty of hearing untouched,
he had annihilated all the melodies and harmonies
of the universe. If a man obliterates my power
of vision, it is precisely the same to me as though he
had blotted out the light of the sun, and flung a pall of
darkness over all the beauties of the earth and the glories
of the firmament. So, if a usurper of human rights
takes away from a child the faculties of knowledge, or
the means and opportunities to know, it is precisely
the same to that child as though all the beauties and
the wonders, all the magnificence and the glory, of the
universe itself had been destroyed. To one who is
permitted to know nothing of the charms and sublimities
of science, all science is non-existent. To one
who is permitted to know nothing of the historical
past, all the past generations of men are a nonentity.
To one whose mind is not made capacious of the
future, and opened to receive it, all the great interests
of futurity have less of reality than a dream. I say,
therefore, in strict, literal, philosophical truth, that
whoever denies knowledge to children works devilish
miracles. Just so far as he disables and incapacitates
them from knowing, he annihilates the objects of
knowledge; he obliterates history; he destroys the
countless materials in the natural world that might,
through the medium of the useful arts, be converted
into human comforts and blessings; he suspends the
sublime order and progression of Nature, and blots out
those wonderful relations of cause and effect that
belong to her unchangeable laws. Nay, there is a
sense in which such an impious destroyer of knowledge
may be said to annihilate the attributes of the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_148">[Pg 148]</span>
Creator himself, for he does annihilate the capacity of
forming a conception of that Creator, and thus prevents
a soul that was created in the image of God
from ever receiving the image it was created to
reflect. Such a destroyer of knowledge dims the
highest moral splendor of the universe. God is more
to me than a grand and solitary Being, though refulgent
with infinite perfections. Contemplated as enthroned
in the midst of his works, his spiritual offspring
in all the grand circuit of the worlds he has
formed become a multiplying glass, reflecting back
the Original in the profusion and countlessness of
infinity. But when the wickedness of man cuts off
entire generations and whole races from the capacity
of reflecting back this radiant image of the Creator,
then all that part of the universe where they dwell
becomes black and revolting, and all that portion of
the Mirror of Souls which was designed to reproduce
and rekindle the glories of the Eternal absorbs and
quenches the rays which it should have caught and
flamed with anew, and multiplied and returned. And
still further, sir, I affirm, in words as true and literal
as any that belong to geometry, that the man who
withholds knowledge from a child not only works
diabolical miracles for the destruction of good, but for
the creation of evil also. He who shuts out truth, by
the same act opens the door to all the error that supplies
its place. Ignorance breeds monsters to fill up
all the vacuities of the soul that are unoccupied by the
verities of knowledge. He who dethrones the idea
of law, bids chaos welcome in its stead. Superstition
is the mathematical complement of religious truth;
and just so much less as the life of a human being is
reclaimed to good, just so much more is it delivered
over to evil. The man or the institution, therefore,
that withholds knowledge from a child, or from a race
of children, exercises the awful power of changing the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_149">[Pg 149]</span>
world in which they are to live, just as much as
though he should annihilate all that is most lovely and
grand in this planet of ours, or transport the victim of
his cruelty to some dark and frigid zone of the universe,
where the sweets of knowledge are unknown,
and the terrors of ignorance hold their undisputed
and remorseless reign. Sir, the laws recorded in the
statute books of the free states, providing the means
of education, and wooing the children to receive the
blessedness of true knowledge, are worthy to be inscribed
as emblems and hieroglyphics upon the golden
gates of heaven; but those laws which deform the
statute books of the slave states of this Union, making
it a penal offence to educate human beings, and dooming
immortal souls to perpetual ignorance, would make
the most appropriate adornment wherewith to embellish
with inscription and bas-relief the pillars of the
council hall of Pandemonium.</p>

<p>Sir, if there is any thing for which I would go back
to childhood, and live this weary life over again, it is
for the burning, exalting, transporting thrill and ecstasy
with which the young faculties hold their earliest
communion with knowledge. When the panting and
thirsting soul first drinks the delicious waters of truth;
when the moral and intellectual tastes and desires first
seize the fragrant fruits that flourish in the garden of
knowledge; then does the child catch a glimpse and
foretaste of heaven. He regales himself upon the
nectar and ambrosia of the gods. Late in life, this
zest is rarely if ever felt so keenly as at the beginning.
Such ought not to be the fact; but our bodies are so
systematically abused by transgressions of the laws of
health and diet, that the sympathizing soul loses the
keenness of its early relish. Even then, however, age
has its compensations. The old may experience the
delights of learning, anew, in the reflex pleasure of
seeing children learn. But these lofty and enduring<span class="pagenum" id="Page_150">[Pg 150]</span>
satisfactions,—this pleasure,—it is no extravagance to
say, this bliss of knowledge, both for parent and child,
is withheld, cruelly, remorselessly withheld, from the
slave. We know all this; we see its imbruting consequences;
and we are compelled to see them, because
the government will uphold slavery here.</p>

<p>Such, sir, is the spectacle which is presented to all
northern men, whenever for duty, for business, or for
pleasure, they visit this metropolis. Wherever we go,
wherever we are, the odious, abhorred concomitants
of this institution are forced upon our observation, and
become a perpetual bitterness in the cup of life. The
whole system, with all its adjuncts, is irreconcilably
repugnant to our ideas of justice. We believe it to be
a denial of the rights of man; we believe it to be
contrary to the law of God. Whether these feelings
wear away by the lapse of time, and the indurating
power of custom, I know not; but, for one, I hope
never to become hardened and callous to the sight;
for it is a case where I could experience no mitigation
of my pains, without a corresponding debasement of
my nature.</p>

<p>Now, in all sincerity, and in all kindness, I ask our
southern brethren what there is to them so valuable
and desirable in retaining slavery here, as to be a compensation
for all the pain and evil which its existence
inflicts upon the north? Surely its abandonment here
would be a small thing to them, while its continuance
is a great thing to us. It is a great thing to us, because
we are held responsible for it by the whole civilized
world. This District is the common possession
of the nation. Congress has power of exclusive legislation
over it. Congress, therefore, is responsible for
its institutions, as a man is responsible for the condition
of his house, and the customs of his family. The
general government is not responsible for the local
institutions of Massachusetts or of Mississippi. Each<span class="pagenum" id="Page_151">[Pg 151]</span>
of them has supreme control over its own domestic
concerns. They may honorably discharge their debts
or repudiate them; they may build up institutions of
charity, of learning, and of religion; or they may
suffer inhumanity and violence, ignorance and paganism,
to prevail; and we, here, cannot help it, and
therefore are not responsible for it. But it is wholly
otherwise with regard to the institutions that prevail
in this District; their honor, or their infamy, attaches
to us. We are judged by them the world round. We
of the Northern States feel it at home; we are made to
feel it still more deeply abroad. Throughout every
nation in Europe, it is the common language and the
common sentiment, that an institution which exists in
one half of the states of this Union is in flagrant contrast
and contradiction to the theory of our government.
When we are reminded of this,—whether in
a kindly and expostulatory manner by our friends, or
in an offensive and taunting one by our enemies,—we
of the north can say, at least, that we are not
responsible for it. We can explain why we are no
more amenable for the local laws of Arkansas or Missouri
than we are for the Catholic religion in Mexico,
or for the revolutions in the South American republics.
This is our answer. But they still retort upon us, and
say, There is one spot for which you are responsible,—the
District of Columbia. You could abolish slavery
there if you would; you do not; and therefore
the sin of its continuance is yours, as much as if it
existed in New York or Massachusetts. Now I ask
southern gentlemen how it is consistent with magnanimity
and honor, with a fraternal feeling towards the
north, for them to force the odium of this inconsistency
upon us? Surely they gain no credit, no character
by it; we lose both credit and character. The
existence of slavery here is no benefit to them; it is
of unspeakable injury to us. They would lose nothing<span class="pagenum" id="Page_152">[Pg 152]</span>
by surrendering it; we suffer every thing by its
continuance. A change would work them no injury;
it would be invaluable to us. I ask them, on principles
of common fairness and good neighborhood, that they
should courteously and voluntarily yield us this point,
which would allay so much bitterness and heart-burning
at the north, and which, according to their view
of the matter, would fill the south with the sweet
savor of a generous deed.</p>

<p>I know, sir, that some southern gentleman profess
to see a principle in such a course that debars them
from adopting it. They say that if slavery in this
District should be surrendered, it would only be giving
the adversary a vantage ground, on which he could
plant himself to attack slavery in the states. I dissent
from this view entirely. Has not the gentleman from
Ohio, [Mr. <span class="smcap">Giddings</span>,] who is supposed to represent
the extreme anti-slavery views which exist in this
House,—has he not declared here, a hundred times
over, that he disclaims all right, that he renounces all
legal authority and pretext, under the constitution, to
lay the hands of this government, for the purpose of
freeing him, on a single slave in the slave states? But
clearly the principle is different in regard to slaves in
this District, where we possess the power of “exclusive
legislation.” But if gentlemen at the south see a
principle which debars them from surrendering slavery
in this District, we at the north see a principle which
prompts us, and will prompt us, until the work is
accomplished, to renewed exertions. On the same
ground on which slavery in this District has been
defended for the last fifty years, it can be defended for
the next fifty, or the next five hundred years; it can
be defended forever. This idea of perpetual slavery
in the very household of a republic of freemen is not
to be tolerated, and cannot be tolerated. But I will
not dwell on this topic further. I close this branch<span class="pagenum" id="Page_153">[Pg 153]</span>
of my argument with a proposition which seems to
me but fair and equitable. The south has held this
metropolis as a slave capital for fifty years. Let it now
be held as a free capital for fifty years; and if, at the
end of this period, adequate reasons can be shown, before
any nation, civilized or uncivilized, upon the face
of the earth, for restoring it to slavery again, I, for one,
should have no fears of entering into an engagement
upon such a condition, that it should again become “a
land of Egypt and a house of bondage.”</p>

<hr class="tb">

<p>Notwithstanding I have dwelt so long upon the social
and moral aspects of this subject, I am still tempted
not to forego that which was my principal object in
rising, namely, to submit an argument on the question
of the legality or constitutionality of slavery in this
District. I have bestowed much careful attention upon
this subject, with the sincerest desire of arriving at
true, legal, and constitutional results. I submit my
views with deference, because I know they are in conflict
with the views of others, for whose knowledge
and abilities I have a profound respect.</p>

<p>The legality of slavery in the District of Columbia
has been assumed, and practically acquiesced in, for
fifty years. Had the question of its validity been
raised, and argued on the principles of the constitution,
immediately after the creation of the District, I
believe this territory would have been declared free
soil. In my conscientious opinion, slavery exists in
this District only by original usurpation and subsequent
acquiescence. If so, Congress cannot be too
speedily invoked to abdicate the power it has usurped.</p>

<p>1. The first position I take is this: <i>That slavery has
no legal existence any where, unless by force of positive
law.</i></p>

<p>If any man claims authority over the body, mind,
and soul of one of his fellow-men, and claims this<span class="pagenum" id="Page_154">[Pg 154]</span>
authority not only for the whole life of his victim, but a
like authority over all his descendants, there is no part
of the civilized world where he will not be required to
show some positive law, authorizing the power and the
bondage. If the claimant says, “I am stronger, or I
am wiser than he;” or, “I have an Anglo-Saxon brain,
while he has only an African brain;” or, “my skin is
white, and his skin is not white;” or, “I descended
from Shem, and he from Ham; and, therefore, he is my
slave,”—there is not a court in Christendom, which,
though it may admit the fact, will ratify the inference.
If the claimant affirms that it is <i>morally</i> right for him
to seize his fellow-man and reduce him to slavery; if
he brings the Bible into court as his law book, and cites
Abraham and Isaac, and Jacob and Paul, as his authorities;
still, I say, there is not a court in Christendom
that will not deny the validity of the title, and rebuke
the arrogance of the demand.<a id="FNanchor_6" href="#Footnote_6" class="fnanchor">[6]</a> Positive law, then, is
the only foundation of slavery. The authorities are
numerous, if not numberless, to establish this position.
I shall not encumber this argument by citing many of
them. The few which I shall cite will contain a reference
to the rest.</p>

<p>The grand reason against slavery given by Lord
Mansfield, in Somerset’s case, was, “that it is so intrinsically
wrong that it is incapable of being introduced<span class="pagenum" id="Page_155">[Pg 155]</span>
into any country, on any reasons moral or political, and
can only stand on positive law.” 20 State Trials, 1.</p>

<p>Chief Justice Marshall says, “That it [slavery] is contrary
to the law of nature, will scarcely be denied.
That every man has a natural right to the fruits of his
own labor, is generally admitted; and that no other
person can rightfully deprive him of those fruits and
appropriate them against his will, seems to be the
necessary result of this admission.” Antelope, 10
Wheat., 120.</p>

<p>“The first objection,” says Mr. Justice Best, in the
case of Forbes and Cochrane, “which occurs to me, in
this case, is that it does not appear, in the special case,
that the right to slaves exists in East Florida. <i>That
right is not a general but a local right</i>; it ought, therefore,
to have been shown that it existed in Florida, and
that the defendants knew of its existence. Assuming,
however, that those facts did appear, still, under the
circumstances of this case, this action could not be
maintained.</p>

<p>“The question is, Were these persons slaves at the
time when Sir G. Cockburn refused to do the act which
he was desired to do? I am decidedly of opinion that
they were no longer slaves. The moment they put
their feet on board of a <i>British</i> man-of-war, not lying
within the waters of East Florida, (where undoubtedly
the laws of that country would prevail,) those persons
who had before been slaves were free....
Slavery is a local law, and, therefore, if a man wishes
to preserve his slaves, let him attach them to him by
affection, or make fast the bars of their prison, or rivet
well their chains; <i>for the instant they get beyond the
limits where slavery is recognized by the local law,
they have broken their chains, they have escaped from
their prison, and are free</i>.” 2 Barn. &amp; Cres. 466-7;
<i>Forbes</i> vs. <i>Cochrane</i>, S. C., 3 Dowl. &amp; Ryland, 679.</p>

<p>“I am of opinion,” says Holroyd, J., in the same<span class="pagenum" id="Page_156">[Pg 156]</span>
case, “that according to the principles of the English
law the right to slaves, even in a country where such
rights are recognized by law, must be considered as
founded, not upon the law of nature, but upon the
particular law of that country.”</p>

<p>“The law of slavery is a law <i>in invitum</i>; <i>and when
a party gets out of the territory where it prevails</i>, and
out of the power of his master, and gets under the protection
of another power, without any wrongful act
done by the party giving that protection, the right of
the master, <i>which is founded on the municipal law of
the particular place only</i>, does not continue, and there
is no right of action against a party who merely receives
the slave in that country, without doing any
wrongful act.”</p>

<p>The definition of slavery given by the Roman law
implies that it is local: <i>Servitus est constitutio juris
gentium, qua quis dominio alieno</i>, <span class="allsmcap">CONTRA NATURAM</span>,
<i>subjicitur</i>. <i>Commonwealth</i> vs. <i>Aves</i>, 18 Pick. Rep.,
193; <i>Lunsford</i> vs. <i>Coquillon</i>, 14 Martin’s Rep. 402.
“The relation of owner and slave is a creation of the
municipal law.” <i>Rankin</i> vs. <i>Lydia</i>, 3 Marshall, 470,
Ky.; <i>Butler</i> vs. <i>Hopper</i>, 1 Wash. C. C. Rep. 499;
<i>Ex parte Simmons</i>, 4 Wash. C. C. 296; <i>Marie Louise</i>
vs. <i>Marot et al.</i>, 9 Curry’s Louisiana Rep. 473.</p>

<p>This point may be presented in another light. By
the law of nature all men are free. But in some governments
the law of the state, upheld by the power of
the state, overrides the law of nature, and enslaves a
portion of the people. The law of nature recedes before
this legalized violence; but it recedes no farther
than the legalized violence drives it back. Within the
jurisdictional limits of such states, then, slavery is made
<i>legal</i>, though it is not made <i>right</i>. But if a slave
passes out of the jurisdiction where violence overpowers
right, into a jurisdiction where right is superior to violence,
he is then free; not because there is any change<span class="pagenum" id="Page_157">[Pg 157]</span>
in the man, but because there is a change in the laws
to which the man is subject.</p>

<p>There may, however, be some further positive law
which, though it does not authorize the buying or selling
of a slave, still does provide that an escaped or escaping
slave may be recaptured and redelivered into
bondage. Such is the third paragraph of the second
section of the fourth article of the constitution of the
United States. Such, too, is the act of Congress of
February 12, 1793, providing for the recapture of fugitive
slaves. This, however, would not be without
positive law.</p>

<p>The debates in all the conventions for adopting the
constitution of the United States, proceed upon the
ground that slavery depends upon positive law for its
existence. If it did not,—if a man who has a legal
right to a slave in Virginia, has a legal right to him anywhere,—then
the provision in the constitution, and the
act of 1793 for recapturing fugitive slaves, would have
been unnecessary.</p>

<p>On the south side of a boundary line, then, slavery
may exist by force of positive law; while, on the north
side, in the absence of any such law, slavery is unlawful.
A slave passing out of a jurisdiction where slavery
is legalized, into a jurisdiction where it is not, becomes
free. It is as though a man should migrate from one
of those South Sea islands, where cannibalism is legalized,
and where the public authorities, according to the
reports of travellers, not only condemn and execute a
criminal, <i>but dine on him, after he is executed</i>,—it is,
I say, as though the subject of such a government
should migrate into one where cannibalism is not lawful,
and where, therefore, though he should be condemned
and executed for crime, it would be no part of
the sentence or the ceremony that he should be eaten
by his judges. He is out of cannibal jurisdiction.</p>

<p>The right of freedom is a natural right. It is a positive<span class="pagenum" id="Page_158">[Pg 158]</span>
existence. It is a moral entity. Like the right
to life, it pertains, by the law of nature and of God, to
every human being. This moral right continues to
exist until it is abolished. Some act abolishing this
freedom, then, must be proved; it must be proved affirmatively,
or else the fact of freedom remains. This
is the solid and indestructible ground of the maxim,
that slavery can exist only by positive law; that it is a
<i>local</i> institution; that the right of freedom must first
be abolished before slavery can exist.</p>

<p>2. My second position is this: <i>That a man’s legal
condition may be changed by a change in the government
over him, while he remains in the same place,
just as effectually as it can be changed by his removal
to another place, and putting himself under another
government.</i> The inhabitants of the North American
colonies did not change their place of residence when
they passed from under the government of Great Britain,
and came under the government of the confederation.
The Mexicans, inhabiting the then states of
California and New Mexico, did not change their place
of residence, when, on the thirtieth day of May last,
they ceased to be citizens of the Mexican republic, and
became citizens, or <i>quasi</i> citizens of the United States.
Their political relations were changed, not by their
removal from under the canopy of one government and
placing themselves under the canopy of another government,
but by the withdrawal of one government from
over them, and by the extension to them of certain <i>political</i>
rights and capacities under another government.
Before this thirtieth day of May, they could have committed
treason against Mexico, but not after it. Before
it, they could not commit treason against the United
States; but when they shall be citizens of the Union,
they can. These vital changes in their relations are
without any change in their residence. Within my
recollection, an old gentleman died in Massachusetts,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_159">[Pg 159]</span>
who had lived in five different towns, but still remained
where he was born, like one of the old oak trees on
the homestead. The part of the original town where
he was born had been set off and incorporated into a
new town; and that part of the second town where he
lived, into a third; and so on, until he died in the fifth
town without any change of domicile. Now, this man
lived under the jurisdiction and by-laws of five towns,
as they were successively incorporated over him, just
as much as though he had struck his tent five times,
and placed himself, by successive migrations, under five
different municipal jurisdictions.</p>

<p>A similar thing must have happened to thousands of
our fellow-citizens of the Union. Some of them at
first lived under a foreign government; then under one
territorial government; then under another; and at last
have become citizens of a state, without any change
of domicile. Indeed, it would seem that nothing can
be clearer than the proposition, whether regarded as a
legal or a political one, that the laws and the jurisdiction
may be changed over a man who continues
to reside in the same place, just as effectually and as
completely as a man may change the laws and jurisdiction
over himself by removing to a different place.
In many cases, the former works a more thorough
change than the latter. The laws of Great Britain do
not acknowledge the right of self-expatriation; while,
at the same time, it is held, that the inhabitants of a
foreign province, incorporated into the kingdom, change
their allegiance without changing their residence.</p>

<p>3. My third proposition is this: <i>That the jurisdiction
under which the inhabitants of what is now the
District of Columbia lived, prior to the cession of the
District by Maryland to the United States, was utterly
and totally changed, at the moment of the cession,—at
the moment when, according to the provisions of the
constitution, they ceased to be citizens of the state of<span class="pagenum" id="Page_160">[Pg 160]</span>
Maryland, and became citizens of the District of
Columbia.</i></p>

<p>By the 17th paragraph, (Hickey’s Constitution,) of
the 8th section of the 1st article, it is provided that
Congress shall have power “to exercise exclusive legislation
in all cases whatsoever over such District, (not
exceeding ten miles square,) as may, by cession of particular
states, and the acceptance of Congress, become
the seat of the government of the United States.”</p>

<p>Congress, then, has the power of sole and exclusive
legislation, “in all cases whatsoever,” in regard to the
District of Columbia. What is the meaning of the
word “exclusive” in this connection? It cannot
mean <i>absolute</i> and <i>uncontrolled</i>; for, if it did, it would
make Congress as sovereign as the Russian autocrat.
It means that no other government, no other body of
men whatever, shall have concurrent power of legislation
over the District; nor, indeed, any subordinate
power, except what may be derived from Congress.
Over every man who is a citizen of one of the United
States, there are two jurisdictions,—the jurisdiction
of the general government, and the jurisdiction of
the state government. There are two governments
that have the power to legislate for him; but there is
only one power,—the Congress of the United States,—that
can legislate for a citizen of the District of
Columbia.</p>

<p>In <i>Kendall</i> vs. <i>The United States</i>, 12 Peters, 524, it
is said, “There is in the District of Columbia no
division of powers between the general and state governments.
Congress has the entire control over the
District, for every purpose of government.”</p>

<p>So it has been held that a justice of the peace in
the District of Columbia is an officer of the government
of the United States, and is therefore exempt

<p>A citizen of the District of Columbia is not a citizen
of any one of the United States. <i>Hepburn et al.</i> vs.
<i>Ellery</i>, 2 Cranch, 445; <i>Westcott’s Lessee</i> vs. <i>Inhabitants ——</i>,

<p>Up to the time of the cession, the inhabitants of this
District were under two jurisdictions—that of Maryland
and that of Congress; but after the cession, under
that of Congress alone. Now, when the inhabitants
of this District passed out of the jurisdiction of
Maryland, and came under the exclusive jurisdiction
of Congress, let us see what was the effect of such
change of jurisdiction upon them.</p>

<p>In the act of Congress of 1790, c. 28, sect. 1, which
was an act for establishing the seat of government of
the United States, there is the following clause: “<i>Provided,
nevertheless</i>, That the operation of the laws of
the state [of Maryland] within such District shall not
be affected by this acceptance, <i>until the time fixed for
the removal of the government thereto, and until Congress
shall otherwise by law provide</i>.”</p>

<p>Here, then, Congress <i>expressly</i> provided and contracted
with the state of Maryland, that the laws of
Maryland in this District should not be interfered with
until the removal of the seat of government to this
place; and Congress likewise <i>impliedly</i> provided and
contracted, that when the seat of government should
be removed to this place, it would discharge the duty
imposed upon it by the constitution of the United
States, and would assume and exercise the “exclusive
legislation” provided for in that instrument. This
act of Congress was approved on the 16th of July,
1790.</p>

<p>By the Maryland laws of 1791, c. 45, sect. 2, that
state ceded to the United States the territory which
now constitutes the District of Columbia, and the
words of the cession are these: “In full and absolute
right, as well of soil as of person, residing or to reside<span class="pagenum" id="Page_162">[Pg 162]</span>
thereon,” &amp;c. ... provided that the jurisdiction
of the laws of Maryland “shall not cease or determine
<i>until Congress shall by law provide for the government
thereof</i>.”</p>

<p>The state of the case, then, was simply this: 1. The
constitution gave Congress power of “exclusive legislation”
over such district as might be ceded for the
seat of government. 2. Congress, by the act of 1790,
above referred to, proposed to the state of Maryland to
accept a portion of her territory for this purpose, but
engaged not to interfere with her laws until after it
had taken actual possession of the ceded territory.
3. Maryland accepted the proposition, rehearsing the
condition in these words; namely, that “the laws of
Maryland shall not cease or determine until Congress
shall by law provide for the government thereof.”</p>

<p>By the 6th section of the act of 1790, c. 28, Congress
provided that it would remove to this District,
and make this the seat of government, on the first
Monday of December, 1800. It did so; and now its
express duty under the constitution, and its implied
promise to the state of Maryland, were to be fulfilled,
by exercising “exclusive legislation” over this District.</p>

<p>In fulfilment of this duty and promise, Congress, on
the 27th of February, 1801, by the act of 1801, c. 15,
proceeded to legislate for the District of Columbia;
and, in the first section of that act, it provided as follows:—</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>“<i>Be it enacted, &amp;c.</i>, That the laws of the state of Virginia,
as they now exist, shall be and continue in force in that part
of the District of Columbia which was ceded by the said
state to the United States, and by them accepted for the permanent
seat of government; and that the laws of the state
of Maryland, as they now exist, shall be and continue in
force in that part of the said District which was ceded by that
state to the United States, and by them accepted, as aforesaid.”</p>
</div>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_163">[Pg 163]</span></p>

<p>By this act, then, Congress assumed to exercise, and
did exercise, that exclusive legislation over the District
of Columbia which had been provided for by the constitution.</p>

<p>That portion of the District which was ceded to
Congress by Virginia, having been receded to that state
by the act of Congress of July 9, 1846, (stat. 1846,
c. 35,) all that relates to it may, for the purposes of
this argument, be laid out of the question.</p>

<p>On the 27th day of February, 1801, then, the laws
of Maryland, <i>as such</i>, were abrogated in this District.
The legislative power of Congress was <i>de facto</i> exclusive.
All legislative power previously possessed by
Maryland over it, then ceased. The connection of Maryland
with this District, as a part of its former territory,
and occupied by its former citizens, was dissolved. It
had no longer any more legislative power over the District
than Maine or Georgia had. Historically, we may
talk about the laws of Maryland, as they once existed
here; but practically, and as a matter of strict law and
fact, her laws were no longer known within the District.
The laws which governed the people of this
District after the 27th day of February, 1801, were the
laws of Congress, and not the laws of Maryland.</p>

<p>To show that this part of the District passed out
from under the government of Maryland, and came
under the government of the United States, I refer to
<i>Reilly, appellant</i>, vs. <i>Lamar et al.</i>, 2 Cranch, 344; 1
Cond. Rep. 322, where it is said, “By the separation
of the District of Columbia from the State of Maryland,
the residents in that part of Maryland which
became a part of the District, ceased to be citizens of
the state.” It was held, in that case, that a citizen of
the District of Columbia could not be discharged by
the insolvent law of Maryland.</p>

<p>A citizen of the District of Columbia cannot maintain
an action in the circuit court of the United States<span class="pagenum" id="Page_164">[Pg 164]</span>
out of the District, he not being a citizen of the state
within the meaning of the provision of the law of the
United States regulating the jurisdiction of the courts
of the United States. <i>Hepburn et al.</i> vs. <i>Ellzey</i>, 2
Cranch, 445; 1 Cond. Rep. 444. See also <i>Loughborough</i>
vs. <i>Blake</i>, 5 Wheat. 317, and <i>Levy Court of
Washington</i> vs. <i>Ringgold</i>, 5 Peters, 451.</p>

<p>4. The next point of inquiry is, <i>What is the legal
force and effect, upon the subject of slavery, of the act
of Congress of 1801, before cited?</i> Its words are,
“That the laws of the state of Maryland, as they
now exist, shall be continued in force in that part of
said District which was ceded by that state to the
United States,” &amp;c. And here, I acknowledge that
the operation of this clause is precisely the same as
though Congress had transcribed all the Maryland
laws, word for word, and letter for letter, into its own
statute book, with the clause prefixed, “Be it enacted
by the Senate and House of Representatives of the
United States of America in Congress assembled,” and
the President of the United States had affixed his signature
thereto. I acknowledge further, that the laws
of Maryland had legalized slavery within the state of
Maryland, and had defined what classes of persons
might be held as slaves therein.</p>

<p>But it by no means follows, because Congress proposed
to reënact, in terms, for this District, all the laws
of Maryland, that, therefore, it did reënact them. It
does not follow, that because two legislatures use the
same words, that the words must necessarily have
the same effect. It makes all the difference in the
world, whether words are used by one possessed of
power, or by one devoid of power. Congress might
pass a law in precisely the same words as those used
by the Parliament of Great Britain, and yet the law
of Congress be invalid and inoperative, while the act
of Parliament would be valid and binding. We have<span class="pagenum" id="Page_165">[Pg 165]</span>
a written constitution; Great Britain has no written
constitution. The British Parliament, on many subjects,
has an ampler jurisdiction than the American
Congress. The law of Congress might be unconstitutional
and void, while that of the British Parliament,
framed in precisely the same language, might be constitutional
and binding.</p>

<p>So the law of Maryland might be valid under the
constitution of Maryland, and, therefore, binding upon
the citizens of Maryland; while the law of Congress,
though framed in precisely the same words, would be
repugnant to the constitution of the United States,
and therefore have no validity.</p>

<p>Now this is precisely the case before us. Congress,
in attempting to reënact the Maryland laws, to uphold
slavery in this District, transcended the limits of its
constitutional power. It acted unconstitutionally. It
acted in plain contravention of some of the plainest
and most obvious principles consecrated by the constitution.
If so, no one will dispute that its act is void.
I do not deny, then, that Congress used words of sufficient
amplitude to cover slavery; but what I deny is,
that it had any power to give legal force to those
words.</p>

<p>5. My next proposition, therefore, is this: <i>That as
Congress can do nothing excepting what it is empowered
to do by the constitution, and as the constitution does
not empower it to establish slavery here, it cannot establish
slavery here, nor continue it.</i></p>

<p>Where is there any <i>express</i> power given to Congress
by the constitution to establish slavery? Where is the
article, section, or clause? I demand to have the title
shown. Thousands of human beings are not to be
robbed of all their dearest rights, and they and their
children, forever, by strained constitutions, or apocryphal
authority, doomed to bondage. Will those who
say that Congress cannot establish a banking institution<span class="pagenum" id="Page_166">[Pg 166]</span>
by construction, nor aid internal improvements,
nor enact a tariff,—will they say that Congress can
make a man a slave, and all his posterity slaves, by
construction?</p>

<p>Nor can any power to establish slavery be deduced
from the 18th clause of the 8th section of the 1st article
of the constitution, which gives Congress power
“to make all laws which shall be necessary and proper
for carrying into execution” the powers that are
granted.</p>

<p>What power is granted to Congress, for the exercise
of which the establishment of slavery in this District
is a necessary means or a preliminary? Congress has
power to lay and collect taxes; to borrow money; to
regulate commerce; to establish uniform rules of naturalization;
to coin money; to punish counterfeiters;
to establish post offices and post roads; to promote the
progress of science and the arts; to establish courts;
to define and punish piracies on the high seas; to declare
war; to raise and support armies; to provide and
maintain a navy; to organize and maintain a militia;
and so forth, and so forth. But to what one of all these
powers is the power to establish slavery in the District
of Columbia a necessary incident? If slavery in
the District of Columbia were to cease to-day, could
not the government continue to exercise every function
which it has heretofore exercised? If so, then the
existence of slavery in this District is not “necessary”
to the exercise of any of the expressly granted powers.
I call upon any gentleman to name any one power of
this government which cannot be exercised, which
must necessarily cease, if slavery should cease to be, in
this District of Columbia? “I pause for a reply.”</p>

<p>Well, then, if a power to establish slavery in this
District is not among the granted powers, and if it is
not necessary for the exercise of any one of the granted
powers, then it is—no where;—it does not exist at<span class="pagenum" id="Page_167">[Pg 167]</span>
all. No power of Congress, then, exists, either for the
creation or for the continuance of slavery in this District;
and all the legislation of Congress upon this
subject is beyond or against the constitution.</p>

<p>Let me illustrate this in another way. Suppose
there had been a religious establishment in Maryland
at the time of the cession; suppose, under the auspices
of Lord Baltimore, the Catholic religion had been established
as the religion of the state; and that, in
order to punish heresy and secure conformity to the
religion of the state, an inquisition had been founded,
and that the seat of that inquisition had been within
the limits of the District of Columbia, at the time of
the cession; could Congress, in the absence of all express
or implied authority on the subject of establishing
a state religion, have upheld the Catholic religion
here, and appointed the officers of the inquisition to
administer it? The idea is abhorrent to the whole
spirit of the constitution. But Congress had as much
power to establish a national religion here, in the absence
of all express or implied authority to do so, as to
establish slavery here.</p>

<p>Congress, then, does not and cannot legalize slavery
in this District. It found slavery in existence in the
states; and it does not abolish it, or interfere with it,
because it has no power of “exclusive legislation” in
them. But Congress has as much right to go into any
state and abolish slavery there, as any state, even Virginia
or Maryland, has to come into this District with
its laws and establish slavery here. I suppose that no
jurist will contend that Congress could have passed the
act of 1793, for the recapture of fugitive slaves, had it
not been for the third clause in the second section of
the fourth article of the constitution, which provides
for the redelivery of a fugitive slave, on the claim of
his master. By this article in the constitution, the case
of <i>fugitive</i> slaves only is provided for. If a master<span class="pagenum" id="Page_168">[Pg 168]</span>
voluntarily carries his slave into a free state, and the
slave departs from his possession, he cannot reclaim
him. Why not? Why cannot Congress pass a law,
that if a man takes a dozen slaves to Boston, and they
there see fit to strike for wages, and to leave his possession
because their terms are not complied with,—why
is it, I ask, that Congress cannot pass a law authorizing
their seizure and delivery into the master’s
hands? The reason is, that the constitution has conferred
upon Congress no such express power, nor is any
such power implied as being necessary to the exercise
of any power that is expressed. And if Congress cannot
so much as restore a slave to a master, who has
voluntarily carried him into a free state, how can it
continue slavery in this District, after Maryland has
ceded it to this government, whose fundamental,
organic law gives it no power to create or continue
slavery here?</p>

<p>Suppose Maryland had ceded her share of the District
to Massachusetts, would not every slave in it have
been instantaneously free by the constitution of Massachusetts?
They would have been transferred to a
free jurisdiction,—just as much as an individual owner
of a slave transfers him to a free jurisdiction, when
he voluntarily takes him to the north. The legal existence
of slavery was annulled in this District when
Congress exercised its “exclusive” power over it, just
as much as the debtor’s right to be discharged under the
Maryland bankrupt law was annulled.</p>

<p>But I go further than this; and I say that the constitution
not only does not empower Congress to establish
or continue slavery in this District, but again and
again, by the strongest implications possible, it prohibits
the exercise of such a power.</p>

<p>In regard to this whole matter of slavery, the constitution
touches the subject with an averted face.
The abhorred word “<i>slave</i>” is nowhere mentioned in<span class="pagenum" id="Page_169">[Pg 169]</span>
it. The constitution is ashamed to utter such a name.
The country, coming fresh from that baptism of fire,—the
American Revolution,—would not profane its
lips with this unhallowed word. Hence, circumlocution
is resorted to. It seeks to escape a guilty confession.
Like a culprit, in whom some love of character
still survives, it speaks of its offence without calling it
by name. It uses the reputable and honorable word
“persons,” instead of the accursed word “slaves.” As
the Tyrian queen, about to perpetrate a deed which
would consign her character to infamy, called it by the
sacred name of “marriage,” and committed it,—</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">
  <div class="stanza">
    <div class="verse indent0">“<i>Hoc prætexit nomine culpam</i>;”</div>
  </div>
</div>
</div>

<p class="p0">so the constitution, about to recognize the most guilty
and cruel of all relations between man and man, sought
to avert its eyes from the act, and to pacify the remonstrances
of conscience against every participation in
the crime, by hiding the deed under a reputable
word.</p>

<p>But let us look to the prohibitions of the constitution;
for I maintain that there is not only no power,
express or implied, in the constitution authorizing
Congress to create or continue slavery in this District,
but that it is debarred and prohibited from doing so,
again and again.</p>

<p>I suppose no one will deny that the positive prohibitions,
against the exercise of certain enumerated
powers, apply to Congress, when legislating for this
District, just as much as when legislating for the
union at large. This doctrine has recently been
strongly asserted by Mr. Calhoun in the Senate of the
United States; and, as I would gladly produce conviction
in southern minds, I make use of this southern
authority. He affirms that Congress, in legislating for
the territories, “is subject to many and important restrictions
and conditions, of which some are expressed<span class="pagenum" id="Page_170">[Pg 170]</span>
and others implied. Among the former may be
classed all the general and absolute prohibitions of the
constitution; that is, all those which prohibit the exercise
of certain powers under any circumstances. In
this class is included the prohibition of granting titles
of nobility; passing <i>ex post facto</i> laws and bills of
attainder; the suspension of the writ of <i>habeas corpus</i>,
except in certain cases; making laws respecting the
establishment of religion, or its free exercise, and every
other of like description.”</p>

<p>Will any man say that Congress can pass an <i>ex post
facto</i> law for this District, and defend itself by referring
to its power of “exclusive legislation” over it?
Can Congress pass a bill of attainder corrupting the blood
of an inhabitant of this District, or repeal or suspend
at any time his right to a writ of <i>habeas corpus</i>, or
establish a religion here, or interdict the free exercise
thereof? No jurist, no statesman, will pretend it.</p>

<p>But there is another prohibition in the constitution
every whit as full and explicit as any of these. The
fifth article of amendment declares that “no person
shall be deprived of life, liberty, or property, without
due process of law.”</p>

<p>Here the constitution uses the word “person,”—the
most comprehensive word it could find. “No
PERSON shall be deprived of life, liberty, or property,
without due process of law.” Now, what does this
word “person” mean? Or who, under the constitution,
is such a “person” as cannot be deprived of life,
liberty, or property, by virtue of an act of Congress,
<i>without due process of law</i>? Let us take our definition
of the word “<i>person</i>” from the constitution
itself. “No <i>person</i> shall be a representative, who shall
not have attained the age of twenty-five years,” &amp;c.,
(see 2d clause of the 2d section of the 1st article.)
“Representatives and direct taxes shall be apportioned
among the several states which may be included within<span class="pagenum" id="Page_171">[Pg 171]</span>
this union, according to their respective numbers,
which shall be determined by adding to the whole
number of free <i>persons</i>, including those bound to service
for a term of years, and excluding Indians not
taxed, three fifths of all other <i>persons</i>.” (3d clause of
the same section.) “No <i>person</i> shall be a senator
who shall not have attained the age of thirty years,”
&amp;c. (1st art., 3d section, 3d clause.) “No <i>person</i>
shall be convicted [of an impeachable offence, by the
Senate] without the concurrence of two thirds.” (1st
art., 3d section, 6th clause.) “No <i>person</i> holding any
office under the United States, shall be a member of
either House, during his continuance in office.” (1st
art., 6th section, 2d clause.) “The migration or importation
of such <i>persons</i> as any of the states now existing
shall think proper to admit, shall not be prohibited,”—“but
a tax, or duty, may be imposed on such
importation, not exceeding ten dollars for each <i>person</i>,”
&amp;c. (1st art., 9th section, 1st clause.) “No <i>person</i>
holding any office of profit or trust,” “shall accept any
present,” &amp;c. (1st art., 9th section, 8th clause.) “No
<i>person</i> holding an office of trust or profit under the
United States, shall be appointed an elector.” (2d art.,
1st section, 2d clause.) “The electors shall meet in
their respective states and vote by ballot for two <i>persons</i>,”
&amp;c. “The <i>person</i> having the greatest number
of votes shall be the President,” &amp;c. “If no <i>person</i>
have a majority,” &amp;c. “In every case, after the choice
of the President, the <i>person</i> having the greatest number
of votes of the electors, shall be Vice President.”
(2d art., 1st section, 2d clause.<a id="FNanchor_7" href="#Footnote_7" class="fnanchor">[7]</a>) “No <i>person</i> except a
natural born citizen,” &amp;c., “shall be eligible to the office
of President; neither shall any <i>person</i> be eligible to
that office, who shall not have attained the age of<span class="pagenum" id="Page_172">[Pg 172]</span>
thirty-five years,” &amp;c. “No <i>person</i> shall be convicted
of treason, unless on the testimony of two witnesses,”
&amp;c. (3d art., 3d sect., 3d clause.) “A <i>person</i>
charged in any state with treason,” &amp;c. (4th art., 2d
section, 2d clause.) “No <i>person</i> held to service or
labor,” &amp;c. (4th art., 2d section, 3d clause.)</p>

<p>Now, it will be seen from all this, that the word
“<i>person</i>” is used in the constitution in the most comprehensive
sense. It embraces Indians, if taxed; it
embraces natives of Africa; it embraces apprentices
and slaves, or those held to service or labor; and it
embraces every citizen, from the humblest to the highest,
from the most true to the most treasonable. It
embraces all, from the slave to the President of the
United States. And after having used the word to
embrace all these classes and descriptions of men, it
proceeds to say, in an amendment, that “<i>no</i> PERSON
<i>shall be deprived of life, liberty, or property, without
due process of law</i>.” (<i>Amendment, Article 5.</i>)</p>

<p>The law of Maryland ceded this District to Congress,
“in full and absolute right, as well of soil as of
person, residing, or to reside therein.”</p>

<p>Now Congress, in attempting to legalize slavery in
the District of Columbia, has provided in terms, by its
adoption of the Maryland laws, that one man may hold
another man in bondage in this District, “<span class="allsmcap">WITHOUT
DUE PROCESS OF LAW</span>,” and indeed without any process
of law; may hold him in bondage from his birth;
may beget him, and still hold him and his posterity in
bondage. “Process of law” means legal proceedings
and a jury trial. It is a phrase that does not pertain to
the legislature, but to the courts. It means the institution
of a suit in civil matters; the finding of an indictment,
or an information in criminal ones; the issuing
of subpœnas for witnesses, &amp;c., in both. (See
<i>Art. 6 of Amendments to the Constitution</i>.)</p>

<p>Now, a slave is a <i>person</i> deprived of his liberty and<span class="pagenum" id="Page_173">[Pg 173]</span>
property, without any process of law. There has
been no “due” process of law to reduce him to this
miserable condition; there has been no process of law
at all. A slave, therefore, in this District, is deprived
of his liberty and property, in pursuance of the laws
of Congress, without <i>any</i> legal process whatever, and
therefore in flagrant contradiction of the fifth article
of the Amendments to the Constitution of the United
States. Hence, the act of Congress, purporting to
continue the Maryland laws respecting slavery in this
District, was, and is, and forever must be, until the
constitution is altered, null and void.</p>

<p>There is a striking historical fact in regard to the
phraseology of this fifth article of amendment. Its
substance was proposed by several states. Virginia proposed
it in the following words: “No <i>freeman</i> ought
to be taken, imprisoned, or disseized of his freehold
liberties, privileges, or franchises, or outlawed or exiled,
or in any manner destroyed or deprived of his
life, liberty, or property, but by the law of the land.”
(See <i>3 Elliot’s Debates, 593—Proceedings of June
27, 1788</i>. <i>Also, 4 Elliot’s Debates, 216, for the same
amendment, as proposed by the State of New York</i>.)</p>

<p>The Virginia amendment used the word “freeman.”
It proposed that no “freeman” should be deprived,
&amp;c. The New York amendment used the word
“<i>person</i>.” And the amendment was adopted and ratified,
almost in the words of the New York phraseology.
The word <i>person</i> was chosen, and therefore
Congress has no constitutional power to deprive of
life, liberty, or property, <i>without due process of law</i>,
any being embraced in the definition of that word.
By its own selection of words it is debarred not
merely from depriving a “<i>freeman</i>,” but from depriving
a “<i>person</i>” of this right.</p>

<p>When Congress attempted to legalize and perpetuate
slavery in this District, it violated the fourth article of<span class="pagenum" id="Page_174">[Pg 174]</span>
the Amendments, which declares “the right of the
people to be <i>secure</i> in their persons, houses, papers,
and effects, against unreasonable searches and seizures.”
If Congress cannot authorize domiciliary searches and
seizures against a single individual, can it degrade a
whole race of men to the condition of slaves, and then
say that <i>because they are slaves</i>, they shall not be
“secure;” but shall be at the mercy of any alleged
master, in regard to their persons,—to be commanded
and restrained, to be bought and sold? If Congress
cannot authorize searches and seizures of houses, papers,
and effects, can it get round the constitution, by
saying we will create a class of persons who shall have
no power of owning any houses, papers, or effects, to
be searched or seized?</p>

<p>Again; Congress shall pass “no bill of attainder.”
What is a bill of attainder? It is a bill that works
corruption of blood. It disfranchises its object. It
takes away from him the common privileges of a citizen.
It makes a man incapable of acquiring, inheriting,
or transmitting property; incapable of holding
office, or acting as attorney for others; and it shuts the
door of the courts against him. These disabling consequences
may descend to a man’s children after him,
though this is not necessary. Now, to pass such a bill
is a thing which Congress cannot do. But when Congress
undertook to legalize slavery in this District, it
undertook to do all this, and worse than all this. It
attainted, not individuals merely, but a whole race. A
slave is an outlaw; that is, he cannot make a contract;
he cannot prosecute and defend in court; property
cannot be acquired by him, or devised to him, or transmitted
through him. A white man may give his testimony
against him, but he cannot give his testimony
against a white man. He is despoiled of his <i>liberam
legem</i>,—his birthright. He cannot own the food or
clothes he has earned. What is his, is his master’s.<span class="pagenum" id="Page_175">[Pg 175]</span>
And this corruption of blood, which the law of slavery
works, does not stop with the first, nor with the second
generation,—not with the tenth nor the ten thousandth;
but by the theory of the law, goes on forever.
Bills of attainder, during the history of the worst periods
of the world, have applied to individuals only, or at most
to a family. But here, Congress, in defiance of the constitution,
has undertaken to establish a degraded caste
in society, and to perpetuate it through all generations.
Now, can any reasonable man for a moment suppose
that the constitution meant to debar Congress from
passing acts of attainder against individuals, but to
permit it to pass wholesale, sweeping laws, working
disfranchisement of an entire race, and entailing degradation
forever?</p>

<p>Let us look at another general prohibition of the
constitution: “No title of nobility shall be granted by
the United States.” (art. 1, § 9, clause 8.) “The distinction
of rank and honors,” says Blackstone, “is
necessary in every well-governed state, in order to reward
such as are eminent for their services to the
public.” But the framers of the constitution did not
think so; the people of the United States did not
think so; and therefore they incorporated a provision
into their organic law that “no title of nobility should
be granted.” But it matters not whether the favored
individual is called “Marquess” or “Master.” If he
is invested by the government with a monopoly of
rights and privileges, in virtue of his title and its legal
incidents, without any corresponding civil duties, he
belongs to an order of nobility,—he is a nobleman.
Mr. McDuffie defends the institution of slavery, on the
ground that it establishes the highest of all ranks and
the broadest of all distinctions between men. He says
no nation has yet existed which has not in some form
created the distinction of classes,—such as patrician
and plebeian, or citizen and helot, or lord and commoner,—and<span class="pagenum" id="Page_176">[Pg 176]</span>
that the institution of slavery stands
here instead of these orders, and supersedes them all,
by being equivalent to them all. Now, is it not inconceivable
that the constitution should interdict the bestowment
of special favors to distinguished individuals
for meritorious services, and yet should authorize
Congress to confer the highest of all earthly prerogatives,—the
prerogative over property, liberty, and volition
itself, upon one class of men over another class
of men? Yet if Congress can create or legalize slavery,
it can establish the worst order of nobility that
ever existed. It can give to one class of men the
power to own and to control, to punish and to despoil
another class; to sell father, mother, wife, and children,
into bondage. To prohibit Congress from doing one of
these things, and to permit it to do the other, is straining
at a gnat and swallowing a camel,—a whole
caravan of camels!</p>

<p>But the same clause in the constitution which gives
Congress the power of exclusive legislation over this
District, also empowers it “to exercise like authority
over all places purchased by the consent of the legislature
of the state, in which the same shall be, for the
erection of forts, magazines, arsenals, dock-yards, and
other needful buildings.” If, then, Congress has any
constitutional power to legalize slavery in this District,
it has the same power to legalize it, (that is, to create
it,) in all places in the state of Massachusetts, or New
York, or any other, where it may have obtained territory
from a state for a fort, magazine, arsenal, dock-yard,
or other needful building. Where it has obtained
land in the middle of a city,—Philadelphia, New
York, Boston, or Chicago,—for a custom-house, it
may create slavery there. The power to do this is
conferred in precisely the same words as the power by
which it has been held that slavery can be established
in the District of Columbia.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_177">[Pg 177]</span></p>

<p>And now I will occupy the few minutes that are
left me, in considering what seems to me the only
plausible argument that can be urged in favor of the
constitutionality of slavery in this District.</p>

<p>It may be said, that when a territory is obtained by
one nation from another, whether by conquest or by
treaty, the laws which governed the inhabitants at the
time of the conquest or cession, remain in force until
they are abrogated by the laws of the conquering or
purchasing power. For this principle, the authority
of Lord Mansfield, in the case of <i>Campbell</i> v. <i>Hall</i>,
1 Cowper, 208, may be cited. The decision of our
own courts are to the same effect. (See <i>United States,
appellant</i>, vs. <i>Juan Percheman</i>, 2 Gallison’s Reports,
501; <i>Johnson</i> vs. <i>McIntosh</i>, 7 Peters, 51; 8 Wheat.
543.) I do not dispute the authority of this case. But
it does not touch the question I am arguing; or, so far
as it bears upon it at all, it confirms the views I would
enforce. The principle is, that the existing laws remain
in force <i>until</i> they are abrogated. I agree to
this. But in the case of the District of Columbia,
there was a special agreement between Maryland and
the United States, that as soon as the United States
should legislate for the District, the laws of Maryland,
<i>as such</i>, should cease to be operative here. On the
27th day of February, 1801, therefore, all the rights
which the citizens of this District possessed, they possessed
under the law of Congress, and not under the
law of Maryland. On the day preceding, a citizen
could have voted for governor or other state officers
of Maryland; but on the day following, he could no
longer vote for any such officer. On the day preceding,
he could have voted for electors of President
and Vice President of the United States; but on the
day following, he was bereft of all such right of the elective
franchise, and must accept such officers and legislators
as the rest of the country might choose to elect<span class="pagenum" id="Page_178">[Pg 178]</span>
for him. On the day preceding, he might, in the character
of an insolvent debtor, have been discharged under
the insolvent laws of Maryland; but on the day following,
he could no longer be so discharged. On the
day preceding, he might have been required, though a
justice of the peace of the State of Maryland, to perform
militia duty; but on the day following, if commissioned
as a justice of the peace of the District of
Columbia, he could not be compelled to perform militia
duty, because he would, in such case, be an officer of
the United States. On the day preceding, he might
have sued in the circuit court of the United States, as
being a citizen of Maryland; but, on the day following,
he could not so sue, because he had ceased to be
a citizen of a state. Thus the change of jurisdiction
over him deprived him of some privileges, and relieved
him from some burdens. It deprived him of these
privileges, and relieved him from these burdens, notwithstanding
the act of Congress had said, in unambiguous
words, “the laws of the State of Maryland, <span class="allsmcap">AS
THEY NOW EXIST</span>, <i>shall be and continue in force</i> in that
part of the said District which was ceded by that state
to the United States.” But the most momentous
change which was wrought by the transfer of the citizen
from the jurisdiction of Maryland to the jurisdiction
of the United States, was that which made it impossible
for him any longer to hold a slave. Under
the laws of Maryland, he might have held his slave,
for her statutes had legalized slavery; but under the
constitution of the United States, he could not hold a
slave; for that constitution had given Congress no
power to legalize slavery in this District, and had gone
so far as to make prohibitions against it. His right to
hold slaves then expired, or fell, like his right to vote
for United States’ officers, or for state officers, or his
right to be discharged under the Maryland insolvent
law, or his right to sue in certain courts, &amp;c., &amp;c.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_179">[Pg 179]</span></p>

<p>One point more, sir, and I have done. Why, says
my opponent, did not the right to hold slaves continue
after the change of jurisdiction, as well as the right to
hold horses? For the plainest of all reasons, I answer:
for the reason that a horse is <i>property</i> by the universal
consent of mankind, by the recognition of every civilized
court in Christendom, without any positive law
declaring it to be the subject of ownership. But a
<i>man</i> is not property, without positive law; without a
law declaring him to be the subject of ownership.
There was such a positive law in Maryland; but Congress,
for want of constitutional authority, could not
enact, revive, or continue it. And such I verily believe
would have been the decision of the Supreme Court
of the United States, had the question been carried
before them immediately subsequent to the act of
1801. But now, as slavery has existed practically in
this District for half a century, it is proper to pass a
law abolishing it. It is better, under the present circumstances,
that slavery should be abolished here by
a law of Congress, than by the decision of a court;
because Congress can provide an indemnity for the
owners, and let the slaves go free. But should it be
abolished by a legal adjudication, every slave would
be hurried away to the south, and sold, he and his descendants,
into perpetual bondage.</p>

<p>In justice, then, to the north, which ought not to
bear the opprobrium of slavery in this capital of the
nation; in justice to the slaves who are here held in
bondage against legal, as well as natural right; and, in
more than justice to the masters, whose alleged claims
I am willing, under all the circumstances, to satisfy,
let a law be forthwith passed for ascertaining and paying
the market value of the slaves, and for repealing all
laws which uphold slavery in this District.</p>

A few years ago, a citizen of the State of Connecticut absconded,

claimed the property acquired in Mississippi. The claim was
contested. The honorable <span class="smcap">Henry S. Foote</span>, now a senator from that

the legality and the propriety of the concubinage, and the divine authority

<p>
<span class="smcap">Mr. Chairman;</span><br>
</p>

<p>Ever since the organization of this House,—before
its organization, and even in a preliminary caucus that
preceded the commencement of the session, southern
gentlemen have pressed the cause, not only of human
slavery, but of slavery extension, upon us. From
motives of forbearance, and not from any question as
to our rights, we of the north have maintained an
unbroken silence. The time has surely come when
the voice of freedom should find an utterance. Would
to God that on the present occasion it might find an
abler defender than myself, although if my ability to
defend it were equal to the love I bear it, it could ask
no stronger champion.</p>

<p>I wish to premise a few words respecting the propriety
and true significance of some of the epithets by
which the parties to this discussion are characterized.
The term “Free Soiler” is perpetually used upon
this floor as a term of ignominy and reproach; yet I
maintain that in its original and legitimate sense, as
denoting an advocate of the doctrine that all our territorial
possessions should be consecrated to freedom,
there is no language that can supply a more honorable
appellation. It expresses a determination on the part
of its disciples to keep free the territory that is now
free; to stand upon its frontiers as the cherubim stood<span class="pagenum" id="Page_181">[Pg 181]</span>
at the gates of Paradise, with a flaming sword to turn
every way, to keep the sin of slavery from crossing
its borders. If, in any instance, the original advocates
of Free Soil have abandoned their integrity, and have
courted allies who had no sympathy with their principles,
but were only eager to join them in a struggle
for mere political ascendency, then, in my judgment,
they have lost infinitely more in moral power than they
have gained in numbers. They have ceased to be
genuine and single-hearted Free Soilers, whom I love,
and have become partisans, whom I condemn. For
myself, I will engage in any honorable measure most
likely to secure freedom to the new territories. I will
resist any and every measure that proposes to abandon
them to slavery. The epithet “Free Soiler,” therefore,
when rightly understood and correctly applied, implies
both political and moral worth; and I covet the honor
of its application to myself. But what does its opposite
mean? What does the term “Slave Soiler” signify?
It signifies one who desires and designs that
all soil should be made to bear slaves. Its dreadful
significancy is, that, after Magna Charta and the Petition
of Right, in Great Britain, and after the Declaration
of Independence, in this country, we should cast
aside with scorn, not only the teachings of Christianity,
but the clearest principles of natural religion and
of natural law, and should retrograde from our boasted
civilization, into the Dark Ages,—ay, into periods
that the dark ages might have called dark. It means
that this <i>Republic</i>, as we call it, formed to establish
freedom, should enlist in a crusade against freedom.</p>

<p>And again; those of us at the north who resist
slavery extension, who mean to withstand its spread
beyond the limits where it now exists, are denounced
as Abolitionists. This epithet is applied to us as a
term of reproach and obloquy; as a brand and stigma
upon our characters and principles. No distinction is<span class="pagenum" id="Page_182">[Pg 182]</span>
made between those few individuals among us who
desire to abolish the constitution of the United States,
and that great body of the people, who, while their
allegiance to this constitution is unshaken, mean also
to maintain their allegiance to truth and to duty, in
withstanding the hitherto onward march of slavery.
Among the latter class, Mr. Collamer, the postmaster-general,
is called an Abolitionist. Mr. John Quincy
Adams was denounced as an arch-Abolitionist. Every
man who advocates the Jefferson proviso, against the
spread of slavery, is so called; and if an unspeakable
abhorrence of this institution, and the belief that it is
the second greatest enormity which the oppressor, in
his power, ever committed against the oppressed, in his
weakness,—being inferior only to that ecclesiastical
domination which has trampled upon the religious
freedom of man,—I say, if this abhorrence of slavery,
and this belief in its criminality, entitle a man to be
denominated an Abolitionist, then I rejoice in my
unquestionable right to the name.</p>

<p>In my apprehension, sir, before we can decide upon
the honor or the infamy of the term “Abolitionist,”
we must know what things they are which he proposes
to abolish. We of the north, you say, are Abolitionists;
but abolitionists of what? Are we abolitionists
of the inalienable, indefeasible, indestructible
rights of man? Are we abolitionists of knowledge,
abolitionists of virtue, of education, and of human
culture? Do we seek to abolish the glorious moral
and intellectual attributes which God has given to his
children, and thus, as far as it lies in our power, make
the facts of slavery conform to the law of slavery, by
obliterating the distinction between a man and a beast?</p>

<p>Do our laws and our institutions seek to blot out
and abolish the image of God in the human soul?
Do we abolish the marriage covenant; and instead of
saying, with the apostle, that wives shall submit<span class="pagenum" id="Page_183">[Pg 183]</span>
themselves to their husbands, command them to submit
themselves to any body, and to their master as
husband over all? Do we ruthlessly tear asunder the
sacred ties of affection by which God has bound the parent
to the child and the child to the parent? Do we
seek to abolish all those noble instincts of the human
soul, by which it yearns for improvement and progress;
and do we quench its sublime aspirations after
knowledge and virtue? A stranger would suppose,
from hearing the epithets of contumely that are heaped
upon us, that we were abolitionists of all truth, purity,
knowledge, improvement, civilization, happiness, and
holiness. On this subject, perversion of language and
of idea has been reduced to a system, and the falsehoods
of our calumniators exclude truth with the
exactness of a science.</p>

<p>But if the word “Abolitionist” is to be used in a
reproachful and contumelious sense, does it not more
properly belong to those who would extend a system
which in its very nature abolishes freedom, justice,
equity, and a sense of human brotherhood? Does it
not belong to those who would abolish not only all
social and political, but all natural rights; who would
abolish “liberty and the pursuit of happiness;” who
would close up all the avenues to knowledge; who
would render freedom of thought and liberty of conscience
impossible, by crushing out the faculties by
which alone we can think and decide; who would
rob a fellow-man of his parental rights, and innocent
children of the tenderness and joys of a filial love;
who would introduce a foul concubinage in place of
the institution of marriage, and who would remorselessly
trample upon all the tenderest and holiest affections
which the human soul is capable of feeling?
After Mr. Jefferson, in the Declaration of Independence,
had enumerated a few oppressive deeds of the
British king towards his American colonists, he denominated<span class="pagenum" id="Page_184">[Pg 184]</span>
him “a prince whose character was marked
by every act that could define a tyrant.” There are
now as many slaves in this country as there were colonists
in 1776. Compare the condition of these three
million slaves with the condition of the three million
colonists. The conduct of that sovereign who was
denounced before earth and heaven as having committed
all the atrocities that could “define a tyrant,”
was mercy and loving-kindness compared with the
wrongs and privations of three millions of our fellow-beings,
now existing among us. If the word “Abolitionist,”
then, is to be used in a reproachful sense, let
it be applied to those who, in the middle of the nineteenth
century, and in defiance of all the lights of the
age, would extend the horrors of an institution which,
by one all-comprehending crime towards a helpless
race, makes it impossible to commit any new crime
against them,—unless it be to enlarge the area of
their bondage, and to multiply the number of their
victims.</p>

<p>If we are abolitionists, then, we are abolitionists of
human bondage; while those who oppose us are
abolitionists of human liberty. We would prevent
the extension of one of the greatest wrongs that man
ever suffered upon earth; they would carry bodily
chains and mental chains,—chains in a literal and
chains in a figurative sense,—into realms where even
the half-civilized descendants of the Spaniard and the
Indian have silenced their clanking. We would avert
the impending night of ignorance and superstition;
they would abolish the glorious liberty wherewith
God maketh his children free. In using this word,
therefore, to calumniate us, they put darkness for light,
and light for darkness; good for evil, and evil for good.</p>

<p>The constitutional right of Congress to legislate for
the territories is still debated. Having presented my
views on this subject before, I shall now treat it with<span class="pagenum" id="Page_185">[Pg 185]</span>
brevity. In a speech, by General Cass, which has
lately been published, that distinguished senator, in
order to prove that Congress has no power to legislate
on the subject of slavery in the territories, has attempted
to prove that it has no right to legislate for the
territories at all. I refer to the senator from Michigan,
because he now stands before the country in the twofold
character of being the head of the Democratic
party, which goes for the “<i>largest liberty</i>,” and also
of the extreme pro-slavery party, which goes for the
<i>largest bondage</i>. He would sever all diplomatic relations
between this country and Austria, because she
has robbed the Hungarians of <i>a part</i> of their liberties,
while he is drawing closer the political ties which bind
him to the south, which has despoiled three millions
of the African race of <i>all</i> their liberties, and is now
intent on propagating other millions for new despoliations.
He claims, as the great bequest of the barons
of Runnymede, that the inhabitants of the territories,
under all circumstances of infancy, or poverty, or
weakness, shall have the sole and exclusive right of
governing themselves, when the practical result of this
doctrine, so nicely timed, would be, that one part of
those inhabitants would be crowned with power like
so many King Johns, to lord it over their vassals.
Under the name of liberty, he enters a path that terminates
in bondage. Southern gentlemen had all
admitted the power of Congress to legislate for the
territories, though they denied the special inference,
deducible from the general power, that they could
legislate to prohibit slavery in them. But, seeing that
the right to legislate on the subject of slavery flows
irresistibly from the right to legislate on all other subjects,
because no rule of interpretation, which concedes
the power to make laws respecting political franchises,
courts, crimes, officers, and the militia, can stop short
at the subject of slavery;—seeing all this, General<span class="pagenum" id="Page_186">[Pg 186]</span>
Cass denies both inference and premises, <i>and places
the general government in the relation of a foreign
power to the territories which it owns</i>, and of which it
possesses the acknowledged sovereignty. He reminds
one of the man who denied the existence of future
punishment, and, when pressed with arguments drawn
from the deserts of men, and from the justice of God,
he suddenly arrested his antagonist by denying the
existence of a God!</p>

<p>When some immensely long speech made in the
British House of Commons, was spoken of before
Sheridan as being <i>luminous</i>, he expressed both a negative
and an affirmative opinion respecting it, in a single
word, by replying that it was <i>vo</i>-luminous. General
Cass, in a speech that fills more than nineteen columns
in the Washington <i>Union</i>, has reviewed the decisions
of all the judges of the Supreme Court who have ever
expressed any opinion on the subject of congressional
power over territorial legislation; he has commented
upon the views of all the jurists who have written
upon it, and of most of the speakers in both Houses of
Congress who have discussed it; he has surveyed the
course of administration of all the Presidents we have
ever had; and has come to the clear conclusion that
all of them,—judges, jurists, legislators, and presidents,—have
systematically violated the constitution
of the United States, or commended its violation, on
every practicable occasion for the last sixty years.</p>

<p>Omitting the hundred ways in which the absurdity
of this conclusion can be exposed, let me subject it to
one practical test. We have acquired territory from
Mexico. General Cass voted to ratify the treaty of
cession. Measures have been instituted for the formation
of three separate governments in this Territory,—those
of California, Deseret, [Utah,] and New Mexico.
The boundaries marked out by California and Deseret
overlay each other to the amount of thousands of square<span class="pagenum" id="Page_187">[Pg 187]</span>
miles. If they have the exclusive right of self-government,
as General Cass declares, and Congress
none, then they must settle this question of boundary
themselves. They may declare war against each
other, make alliances with foreign powers, equip
armies, build fleets; while Congress can do nothing
within their limits but—sell land.</p>

<p>But what renders the argument of General Cass still
more extraordinary is the fact, that, according to his own
doctrine, he has spent the greater part of his political
life in violating the constitution, while constantly repeating
his oath to support it. As marshal of Ohio, as
governor of Michigan, as Indian agent, he has appointed
officers and magistrates, and executed laws,
when, according to his own showing, he was a mere
interloper and usurper; he has met territorial legislatures,
which had no more right to assemble than a
mob; he has doubtless imprisoned, if not executed
many alleged offenders, who had as good a legal right
to execute or to imprison him; and he has received salaries
for more than twenty years, to which the khan of
Tartary was as much entitled as he. Now, if he will
refund the salaries he has unconstitutionally received;
make reparation for the penalties or forfeitures he has
wrongfully extorted; show some signs of contrition
for the men whom he has unlawfully imprisoned or
hung, it will remove the suspicions of many minds, in
regard to the sincerity, if not the soundness, of his
argument.</p>

<p>I mention these facts from no personal feelings in
regard to the senator from Michigan; but only to
show to what desperate extremities men are driven in
order to defend the right of spreading slavery from the
Atlantic to the Pacific ocean; and because this is the
last reading of the constitution which has been invented
for the purpose.</p>

<p>Since the last session of Congress, the condition of<span class="pagenum" id="Page_188">[Pg 188]</span>
a part of this territory has greatly changed. The unexampled
velocity with which a living stream of men
has poured into it within the last twelve months, has
reversed its condition and decided its destiny. In
other countries, <i>individuals</i> seek their fortunes by
changing their residence. Under the vehement action
of our enterprise, <i>cities</i> migrate. The new residents
of California have framed a constitution, have applied
for admission into this Union, and their application is
now pending before us. Of their own accord, they
have excluded slavery from their borders by their fundamental
law. Until the discovery of gold in that
country, and until all incredulity in regard to that
remarkable fact had been overcome, it was confidently
anticipated at the south, and intensely feared at the
north, that the whole region would be overrun with
slaveholders and with slaves. As far back as 1842,
Mr. Wise, of Virginia, the administration leader in the
House of Representatives, boldly declared that “<i>slavery
should pour itself abroad without restraint, and
find no limit but the Southern Ocean</i>.” The war
with Mexico was waged for the twofold purpose of
robbing that republic of its territory, and then robbing
that territory of its freedom. Congressional orators
and the southern press avowed that the object of
acquiring territory was to extend the “divine institution.”
I could quote pages in proof of this assertion.
The north had no hope, the south had no fear, if the
territories were left without control, but that they
would first be filled with slaveholders, and would then
incorporate slavery into their organic law. While
these prospects continued, the south insisted that the
territories should be left untrammelled. Distinguished
men in this House, Mr. Calhoun and other senators,
the government organ, which was supposed to express
the views of President Polk and his cabinet, all proclaimed
that the territories should be left free to<span class="pagenum" id="Page_189">[Pg 189]</span>
institute such government as they might choose.<a id="FNanchor_8" href="#Footnote_8" class="fnanchor">[8]</a> But
since California has formed a <i>free</i> constitution, what a
sudden change has taken place in the convictions of<span class="pagenum" id="Page_190">[Pg 190]</span>
men! Within the present week we have had three most
elaborate speeches in this House, in which the admission
of California, with her free constitution, is vehemently
opposed on constitutional grounds. Yes, sir,
did you know it? <i>the constitution of the United
States has just been altered;</i> or, what is intended to
produce the same effect, without the trouble of an
alteration in the manner prescribed by itself, its interpretation
has been altered. While California promised
to be a slave state, all interference was unconstitutional.
Now, as she desires to be a free state, it has
become constitutional to interfere and repel her. Not
only so, but, according to the gentleman from Alabama,
(Mr. <span class="smcap">Inge</span>,) in swearing to support the constitution
we have sworn to perpetuate, and not only to perpetuate,
but to <i>extend</i> slavery. “To those,” he says,
“who are disposed to resist my views, I commend a
more attentive reading of that instrument. They
will find that it not only guarantees slavery, but provides
for its extension.” Or, as he says in another
place, it makes provision “to extend the institution
indefinitely.” And, therefore, when a territory asks to
be admitted as a free state, it is to be repulsed, and
virtually told, “If you will incorporate slavery into
your constitution, you shall be admitted; if not, not.”
Had the man who first uttered the adage that “circumstances
alter cases,” foreseen our times, he would
have said, “circumstances alter <i>principles</i>.”</p>

<p>The same gentleman defends slavery by an appeal
to the Bible. But if the Bible be authority for the
principal, is it not authority for the incidents also? If<span class="pagenum" id="Page_191">[Pg 191]</span>
an authority for the cruelties of bondage, is it not an
equal authority for its mitigations? Is not the command
to “hallow the fiftieth year,” as a year of jubilee,
and to “proclaim liberty throughout all the land
unto all the inhabitants thereof,” contained in the
same code, and in the same chapter of the same code,
with that oft-cited authority to buy bondmen and
bondmaids of the heathen? If the Bible is your commission,
why do you not follow the terms of the commission,
observing its limitations as well as its powers?
This is the fiftieth year of the century,—the very
year of jubilee itself; and yet, instead of “returning
every man unto his possession, and every man unto
his family,” this is the chosen year for subjugating
new realms to bondage. It is not to be “hallowed,”
as a year of jubilee, but to be profaned as a year of
captivity and mourning.</p>

<p>Sir, I must express the most energetic dissent from
those who would justify modern slavery from the Levitical
law. My reason and conscience revolt from
those interpretations which</p>

<p>Priests appealed to the Bible in Galileo’s time, to
refute the truths of astronomy. For more than two
hundred years, the same class of men appealed to the
same authority to disprove the science of geology.
And now, this authority is cited, not to disprove a law
of physical nature merely, but to deny a great law of
the human soul,—a law of human consciousness,—a
law of God, written upon the tablet of every man’s
heart, authenticating and attesting his title to freedom.
Sir, let those who reverence the Bible beware how
they suborn it to commit this treason and perjury
against the sacred rights of man and the holy law of<span class="pagenum" id="Page_192">[Pg 192]</span>
God. Whatever they gain for the support of their
doctrine, will be so much subtracted from the authority
of the Scriptures. If the Bible has crossed the Atlantic
to spread slavery over a continent where it was unknown
before, then the Bible is a book of death, and
not a book of life.</p>

<p>It is further objected to the admission of California,
that its dimensions are too large for a single state. The
force of this objection is somewhat abated when we reflect
that it comes from men who were most strenuous
for the admission of Texas. However, I shall not object
very earnestly to the reduction of its limits. I will
say, in frankness, that the southern portion of California
is understood to be even more attached to freedom
than the northern. The result may, therefore, be, if
this objection is persisted in and a division made, that
we shall soon have two free states instead of one. It
was said by the last administration, that Mexico was
to be dismembered, in order “to extend the area of
freedom.” The most just retribution for that diabolical
irony is, to carry out the declaration literally.</p>

<p>But I now come to a more substantial part of this
great question. The south rests its claims to the new
territory upon the great doctrine of equality. There
are fifteen slave states; there are only fifteen free states.
The south contributed men and money for the conquest,
not less than the north; hence, equal ownership
and equal rights of enjoyment. This is the argument.
In a long and most elaborate speech, delivered in the
Senate this week by one of the most eminent jurists in
the Southern States, (Judge <span class="smcap">Berrien</span>,) he founds the
whole claim of the south on this doctrine of equality.</p>

<p>Now, I admit this principle in its fullest extent, and
without hesitation. That country is equally free to all
the people of the United States. The government can
sell the lands not already covered by valid titles; and
any citizen who will comply with its terms can buy<span class="pagenum" id="Page_193">[Pg 193]</span>
them. The people of each of the United States can go
there and establish their domicile. The laws of Congress
make no discrimination between them. The constitution
makes no such discrimination. The law of
nature and of nations makes none. The north has no
privilege over the south, and the south has none over
the north. If the north has any greater right there
than the south, the equality is destroyed. If the south
has any greater right there than the north, the equality
is equally destroyed.</p>

<p>And now, practically, what right has the north, or
what right is claimed by the north, which the south has
not to an equal extent? What article of property can
a citizen of Massachusetts carry there which a citizen
of Georgia can <i>not</i> carry there? Can we carry any of
our local laws there; even though all the inhabitants
of the state should remove thither in a body? Certainly
not. When we leave our state, we leave our
local laws behind us. A citizen of Boston has a right
to educate his children at school, at the public expense.
In the Boston public schools, he can prepare his son to
enter any college in this country, even though he is too
poor to pay a cent for taxes, and never has paid a cent
for taxes. Has he any such right on arriving at San
Francisco? If the city of Boston debars him of this
right of educating his son at the public charge, he can
institute a suit against it and recover full damages.
Can he do the same thing at San Francisco or San
Jose? Certainly not. He has left the laws and institutions
of Massachusetts behind him. But, it is said,
we can carry our <i>property</i> there, and you cannot carry
your <i>property</i> there. I think those who use this argument,
like the old Roman augurs, must smile at each
other askance, for the credulity or simplicity of those
they beguile by it. Will not every man, even of the
feeblest discernment, see the fallacy which is here covered
up under the word “<i>property</i>?” What is meant<span class="pagenum" id="Page_194">[Pg 194]</span>
by this deceptive term “<i>property</i>?” If you mean silver,
or gold, or seeds, or grains, or sheep, or horses, cannot
you carry these there as freely as we can? But
you have special laws; local and peculiar laws,—laws
contrary to the great principles of the common law, by
which you call <i>men and women</i> property. And then,
forsooth, because we can carry <i>property</i> there, when
<i>property</i> means grain and cattle, you can carry property
there when it means human beings,—perhaps your
own brothers, or sisters, or children. Because we can
carry our property there, when property means inanimate
substances, you have only to call a human being
<i>property</i>;—you have only to call a creature, formed in
the image of God, <i>property</i>, and then he can be smuggled
in under the new name. Why, sir, there is not a
respectable village in the country, where, if a juggler
or mountebank were to attempt to palm off upon his
audience so flimsy a trick as this, he would not be
hissed from the stage. There are certain kinds of property
and rights which we can carry with us to the territories,
and other kinds which we cannot. We can
carry movable property, but not immovable,—a diamond
or a library, but not a cotton factory nor a cotton
field.</p>

<p>By the papers of this city, as I open them every
morning, I see that lotteries are authorized by more or
less of the Southern States. Their “schemes” are
regularly advertised. I remember, when stopping for
a day in one of the southern cities, that some half-official
looking personages came into the hotel, cleared
a large space in the public hall, set down a rotary machine,
and proceeded to draw a lottery. Now, in Massachusetts,
and in many of the Northern States, lotteries
are prohibited, under severe penalties. With us, it
is highly penal to advertise a lottery in any form, to
placard one at the corners of the streets, or to exhibit
any plan or emblem of one at a shop window. We<span class="pagenum" id="Page_195">[Pg 195]</span>
act upon the well-known truth, that there is a much
less number of persons who draw any considerable
prize in a lottery, than there are who are killed by
lightning; and therefore, whatever chance a ticket-holder
has of drawing any considerable prize, we know
that he has a much greater chance of being killed by
lightning. Now, when a citizen of Virginia and a citizen
of Massachusetts go to the new territories, does
the former carry his right to establish and draw a lottery,
or the latter carry his right to prosecute the other
for doing so? Neither; certainly neither. Both have
left the local law behind them. If any state in this
Union had adopted polygamy as its peculiar institution,
could an inhabitant of that state take a dozen wives
with him into the new territories, and defend his claim
to live with them there, because he could do so at
home? Or, suppose, in pursuance of the “manifest
destiny” principle, we should <i>re</i>-annex a part of China
to this Union, could the Chinese, on removing to California,
carry the practice of infanticide with them?
Just as well, I answer, and on precisely the same legal
ground that the south can carry slavery into New
Mexico. The reason is that the law of slavery is a
<i>local</i> law. Like lotteries, or polygamy, or infanticide,
it can legally exist in no land where the principles of
the common law prevail, until it is legalized and sanctioned
by a special law. Then it is permitted on the
simple ground that so much of the common law as secures
liberty and property, the right of <i>habeas corpus</i>
and freedom of speech to each individual, has been cut
out and cast away. The constitution proceeds upon
this doctrine when it provides for the recapture of fugitive
slaves. Why did it not provide for the capture
of a fugitive horse or ox? Why did it not provide that,
if a horse or an ox should escape from a slave state into
a free state, it should be delivered up, or be recoverable
by legal process? Because horses and oxen are <i>property</i>,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_196">[Pg 196]</span>
by the common consent of mankind. It needed
no law to make them property. They are property by
the law of nations, by the English common law, by the
law of every state in this Union,—<i>while men and
women are not</i>. An escaped slave could not be recovered
before the adoption of the constitution. The
power to seize upon escaping slaves was one of the
motives for adopting it. These considerations demonstrate
that slaves are not <i>property</i>, within the meaning
of this word, when it is affirmed that if the north can
carry <i>its</i> property into the territories, so can the south.
As the constitution, in terms, adopts the common law,
it leaves slavery nothing to stand upon but the local
laws of the states where it is established. Freedom is
the rule, slavery is the exception. Judge Berrien’s
favorite doctrine of equality would, therefore, be destroyed,
if the exception should prevail over the rule.
For, if slavery can be carried into any of our territories
by force of the constitution, it can into all of them;
and if carried into all of them, the exception becomes
the rule, and the rule perishes. Ay, the rule ceases to
be even so much as an exception to that which was <i>its</i>
own exception. It is wholly swallowed up and lost.</p>

<p>I know it is said that the <i>fact</i> of slavery always
precedes the <i>law</i> of slavery; that <i>law</i> does not go before
the institution and create it, but comes afterwards
to sanction and regulate it. But this is no more true
of slavery than of every other institution or practice
among mankind, whether right or wrong. Homicide
existed before law; the law came in subsequently, and
declared that he who took an innocent man’s life
without law, should lose his own by law. The law
came in to regulate homicide; to authorize the taking
of human life for crime, just as we authorize involuntary
servitude for crime; and it may just as well be
argued that murder is a natural right because it existed
before law, as that slavery is a natural right because it<span class="pagenum" id="Page_197">[Pg 197]</span>
existed before law. <i>This argument appeals to the
crime which the law was enacted to prevent, in order
to establish the supremacy of the crime over the law
that forbids it.</i></p>

<p>There is another fallacy in the arguments which
southern gentlemen use on this subject, which, though
not as transparent as the preceding, is quite as unsound.
They speak of the <i>rights</i> of the slaveholder in the new
territories. They speak as though the collective ownership
of the territories by the government, were the
ownership of the people in severalty; as though each
citizen could go there and draw a line round a
“placer,” and say <i>this is mine</i>; and then, <i>because it
is his</i>, introduce his slaves upon it. But nothing is
more clear than that there is no such <i>individual</i> right.
The right of the government is, <i>first</i>, a right of sovereignty
and jurisdiction; and <i>second</i>, the right of ownership
of all lands, navigable waters, &amp;c., which have
not been conveyed away by the preëxisting government.
Individuals retain their citizenship on going there, as
they do on going to Great Britain, or France; but a
slave has just as much right to a portion of the public
lands in California, when he gets there, as his master.</p>

<p>Again; if the master carries into California the legal
right to hold slaves, which he possessed at home, does
not the slave also retain his legal rights when he is
transferred there? The laws which govern slaves are
as various as the states where they exist. In some
states manumission is comparatively unobstructed. In
Delaware, it is a penal offence even to sell a slave to a
notorious slavedealer. In Georgia, the law forbids, or
lately forbade, the importation of slaves for sale. Now,
how can a Georgian import slaves into California from
Georgia, when the very laws of his own state, under
which he claims to hold slaves, and under which laws
he claims to carry slaves with him, forbid their importation?</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_198">[Pg 198]</span></p>

<p>And further, political franchises or privileges are
just as much a part of a man’s rights as any tangible
commodity. In South Carolina, the ownership of ten
slaves constitutes a property qualification for being a
member of the legislature. On removing to California,
will the citizen of South Carolina, who owns ten
slaves, carry an eligibility to the legislature of California
with him? Nay, this political privilege in
South Carolina goes further. It is a right in every
owner of ten slaves, that no man who does not own
ten slaves, (or some legal equivalent,) shall be a member
of the legislature. The aspirant for office has a
legal right in the limitation of the number of his competitors,
as much as in any thing else. Can he carry
<i>this</i> to California with him? The inference is inevitable,
that if the inhabitants of the fifteen slave states
can carry slaves into California by virtue of the laws
of their respective states, then they must also carry all
the incidents of slavery known to their respective
codes. For, how can the incident be separated from
the principal? You might, therefore, have, in a neighborhood
of fifteen families, fifteen slave codes in operation
at the same time,—a manifest absurdity.</p>

<p>The conclusion, then, is irresistible, that when you
come to the boundary line between a slave state and a
free state, you come to the boundary line of slavery
itself. On one side of the line, down to the nadir and
up to the zenith, the blackness of the slave code pervades
all things; but, on the other side, as high above
and as deep below, is the purity of freedom. Virginia
cannot extend her laws one hair’s breadth over the line
into Pennsylvania or into Ohio, because their soil is
beyond her jurisdiction. So neither Virginia, nor all
the fifteen slave states combined, can extend their
slave laws one hair’s breadth into the new territories;
and for the same reason,—the territories are beyond
their jurisdiction.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_199">[Pg 199]</span></p>

<p>As to the argument that the constitution of the
United States recognizes slavery, and that, upon the
cession of new territories, the constitution, by some
magical and incomprehensible elasticity, extends itself
over them, and carries slavery into them, I think I
speak with all due respect when I say it does not come
up to the dignity of a sophism. Where do strict constructionists,
or even latitudinarian constructionists,
find any clause, or phrase, or word, which shows that
the constitution is any thing but a compact between
<i>states</i>? Where do they find any thing that shows it
to be a compact between territories, or between territories
<i>and</i> states conjoined? On its very face, the
constitution meets this pretension with a denial. The
preamble declares, “We the people of the United
States,”—not the people of the territories, nor the
people of the states <i>and</i> territories,—“in order to form
a more perfect Union,”—“do ordain and establish
this constitution for <i>the United States</i> of America.”
If the constitution is a compact between the United
States <i>and</i> the territories, then the people of the territories
have all the rights under it which the people of
the states have,—the right to choose electors for President
and Vice-President, &amp;c., and to be represented
in Congress by a member who can vote as well as
speak. The only way in which the constitution ever
was extended, or ever can be extended over any part
of the earth’s surface outside of the “original thirteen,”
is this: The constitution in express terms authorizes
the admission of new states, and therefore, when a
new state is admitted, it becomes one of these “United
States of America.” The constitution does not extend
over the territories, but Congress, being the creature
of the constitution, is, when legislating for the
territories, not only invested with constitutional powers,
but is limited by constitutional restrictions.</p>

<p>It would have been a much more plausible pretension,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_200">[Pg 200]</span>
when the purchase of Louisiana and Florida was
made, that the constitution carried freedom into those
territories; because the constitution was built upon the
basis of the common law, and, in terms, adopts the
common law for its legal processes and its rules of judicial
interpretation; and every body knows that there
is no principle more dear to the common law than that
all treaties, statutes, and customs shall be construed in
favor of life and in favor of liberty.</p>

<p>Having, as I trust, refuted the argument of the
slaveholder, that the prohibition of slavery in the territories
is an act of injustice to his rights, I will consider
his next assertion, that it is an insult to his feelings.
We are told that the exclusion of slavery from
the territories is an affront to the honorable sensibilities
of the south; and that acquiescence in this
exclusion would involve their dishonor and degradation.</p>

<p>There are two answers to this complaint. The
first is, that among gentlemen, no insult is ever offered
where none is intended. There may be heedlessness
of conduct, there may be an unintentional wounding
of sensibilities; but there can be no affront where the
design to affront is wanting. He is not a gentleman,
but a poltroon and a braggart, who pretends he is insulted
and proceeds to retaliate for the affront, when
all insult and all affront are sincerely disclaimed. Now,
it is infinitely far from the purpose of the north to
offer any indignity to the south by excluding slavery
from the territories. Their hostility to slavery grows
out of an honest allegiance to what they believe to be
the highest moral and religious duty; it is fortified by
the opinions of mankind; and is perfectly compatible
with the most fraternal feelings towards the south.
They wish to expostulate, in regard to the wrong, in
such a way as to arrest the wrong, and not, by inflaming
the wrongdoer, to increase the evil. However<span class="pagenum" id="Page_201">[Pg 201]</span>
erroneous, then, their language or their sentiments may
be, they are not affrontive nor contumelious; and, when
all such purpose is disavowed, those who aspire to
stand on the footing of gentlemen cannot reiterate the
charge.</p>

<p>But there is another consideration,—one which appertains
to the party supposed to be insulted, rather
than the party charged with the insult. In his “Theory
of Moral Sentiments,” Adam Smith maintains that
it is the judgment of men,—the opinion of the bystanders,—that
gives us the pleasure of being approved,
or the pain of being disapproved, on account
of our conduct. Now, in this contest between the
north and the south, on the subject of extending
slavery, who are the bystanders? They are the civilized
nations of the earth. We, the north and the south,
are contending in the arena. All civilized men stand
around us. They are a ring of lookers-on. It is an
august spectacle. It is a larger assemblage than ever
witnessed any other struggle in the history of mankind;
and their shouts of approbation or hisses of scorn are
worthy of our heed. And what do these spectators
say, in the alternations of the combat? Do they urge
on the south to mightier efforts, to the wider spread of
slavery, and the multiplication of its victims? Do
they shout when she triumphs? When new chains
are forged and riveted, when new realms are subdued
by haughty taskmasters, and overrun by imbruted
slaves, do their plaudits greet your ears and rouse you
to more vehement efforts? All the reverse; totally
the reverse. They are now looking on with disgust
and abhorrence. They groan, they mock, they hiss.
The brightest pages of their literature portray you, as
covered with badges of dishonor; their orators hold
up your purposes as objects for the execration of mankind;
their wits hurl the lightnings of satire at your
leaders; their statute books abound in laws in which<span class="pagenum" id="Page_202">[Pg 202]</span>
institutions like yours are branded as crimes; their
moralists, from their high and serene seats of justice,
arraign and condemn you; their theologians find your
doom of retribution in the oracles of God. England
has abolished slavery. France, in one fervid moment of
liberty, struck the chains from off all her slaves, as the
bonds of Paul and Silas were loosed in the inner prison
by the mighty power of God. Sweden has abolished
it. More than twenty years ago, impotent, half-civilized
Mexico did the same. Tunis, a Barbary state,
and, I might add, a barbarous state, has abolished
slavery. Mahometanism precedes Christianity, and sets
it an example of virtue. Liberia, a republic of emancipated
slaves, the very brothers and sisters of those
whom you now hold in bondage, has been acknowledged
as an independent sovereignty, and welcomed
into the family of nations, by two of the most powerful
governments on the globe. By this act, freedom
secures a new domain on the eastern continent, while
you are striving to give a new domain to bondage on
the western. A monarchy hails the advent of a free
nation in Africa, where slavery existed before; a republic
is seeking to create ten thousand absolute despotisms
in America, where freedom existed before.</p>

<p>Now, these are the bystanders and lookers-on in this
grand and awful contestation. They are all agreed, as
one man, in their opinions about it. They are unitedly
visiting your course with execration and anathema.
There is not a nation on the globe, that has a
printing press and a people that can read, from which
you can extort one token of approval. I would agree
to submit the question now at issue between the north
and the south to the arbitrament of any people on
the face of the earth, not absolutely savage, and to
abide its decision. Nay, the wild tribes of the Caucasus
and of Upper India, who have defended themselves
so nobly against aggression, would spurn your<span class="pagenum" id="Page_203">[Pg 203]</span>
claim and deride its pretexts. And yet you say you
are insulted, dishonored, disgraced in the eyes of mankind,
if you are not permitted to bring down upon our
heads, also, the curses they are pouring upon yours.
So far is this from truth, that if you would promptly
and cheerfully consecrate the new territories to freedom,
every nation in the world would send their plaudits
of your conduct to the skies.</p>

<p>But gentlemen of the south not only argue the question
of right and of honor; they go further, and they
tell us what they will proceed to do if we do not yield
to their demands. A large majority of the southern
legislatures have solemnly “resolved” that if Congress
prohibits slavery in the new territories, they will resist
the law “at any and at every hazard.” And yet they
say they do not mean to threaten us. They desire to
abstain from all language of menace, for threats and
menaces are beneath the character of gentlemen. Sir,
what is the meaning of the terms “threats” and
“menaces?” Mr. Troup, formerly governor of Georgia,
speaking of us who are upon this floor, and of others
who resist the extension of slavery, calls each of us a
“fanatic.” He says that it is only the dread of death
that will stay our hands or stop our machinations; and
then adds, “<span class="smcap">That dread you must present to him
in a visible, palpable form</span>.” “If,” he says in another
place, “the abolitionists resolve to force emancipation,
or <i>to force dishonor upon the southern states by
any act of Congress</i>, then it is my decided opinion
that, with the military preparation here indicated, conjoined
to a good volunteer instead of a militia system,
<span class="smcap">the state should march upon Washington and dissolve
the government</span>.” The gentleman from North
Carolina, [Mr. <span class="smcap">Clingman</span>,] forewarns us that if certain
measures,—and they are legal and constitutional measures
which he indicates,—are taken in order to carry
on the business of legislation in this House, the House<span class="pagenum" id="Page_204">[Pg 204]</span>
itself shall be the “Lexington” of a new revolution,
and that “such a struggle would not leave a quorum
to do business.” I could occupy my hour in citing
passages of a similar character from the southern press
and from southern men. Now, if these are not threats,—threats
most gross, flagrant, and offensive,—I know
not the meaning of the word. Perhaps those who
utter such sentiments are only practising an inversion
of language equal to their inversion of ideas on this
subject, and would call them “enticements;” like the
sailor, who said he was enticed to join a mutiny, and
being asked what arts had been used to entice him,
said that the ringleader sprang at him with a handspike,
and swore if he did not join it he would knock out
his brains.</p>

<p>And do those gentlemen who make these threats
soberly consider how deeply they are pledging themselves
and their constituents by them? Threats of
dissolution, if executed, become rebellion and treason.
The machinery of this government is now moving
onward in its majestic course. Custom-houses, post-offices,
land-offices, army, navy, are fulfilling their
prescribed circle of duties. They will continue to
fulfil them until arrested by violence. Should the
hand of violence be laid upon them, then will come
that exigency expressly provided for in the constitution
and in the President’s inaugural oath, “<span class="allsmcap">TO TAKE CARE
THAT THE LAWS BE FAITHFULLY EXECUTED</span>.” Mr.
Chairman, such collision would be <i>war</i>. Such forcible
opposition to the government would be <i>treason</i>. Its
agents and abettors would be <i>traitors</i>. Wherever this
rebellion rears its crest, martial law will be proclaimed;
and those found with hostile arms in their hands must
prepare for the felon’s doom.</p>

<p>Sir, I cannot contemplate this spectacle without a
thrill of horror. If the two sections of this country
ever marshal themselves against each other, and their<span class="pagenum" id="Page_205">[Pg 205]</span>
squadrons rush to the conflict, it will be a war carried
on by such powers of intellect, animated by such vehemence
of passion, and sustained by such an abundance
of resources, as the world has never before witnessed.
“Ten foreign wars,” it has been well said,
“are a luxury compared with one civil war.” But I
turn from this scene with a shudder. If, in the retributive
providence of God, the volcano of civil war
should ever burst upon us, it will be amid thunderings
above, and earthquakes below, and darkness around;
and when that darkness is lifted up, we shall see this
once glorious union,—this oneness of government,
under which we have been prospered and blessed as
Heaven never prospered and blessed any other people,—rifted
in twain from east to west, with a gulf between
us wide and profound, save that this gulf will
be filled and heaped high with the slaughtered bodies
of our countrymen; and when we reäwaken to consciousness,
we shall behold the garments and the hands
of the survivors red with fratricidal blood.</p>

<p>And what is the object for which we are willing to
make this awful sacrifice? Is it to redeem a realm to
freedom? No! But to subjugate a realm to slavery.
Is it to defend the rights of man? No! But to abolish
the rights of man!</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Bowdon</span>. Does not the gentleman think that
such a picture as he has drawn would induce the north
to yield a portion of the new territories to the institution
of slavery?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Mann</span>. I trust that no pictures <i>and no realities</i>
will ever induce us to extend slavery beyond its present
limits. Beyond those limits, “No more slave territories,
no more slave states,” is the doctrine by which
I, for one, shall live and die.</p>

<p>Now, sir, as this event of a dissolution of the Union
is so frequently forced upon our contemplation, I propose
to occupy the residue of my hour in considering<span class="pagenum" id="Page_206">[Pg 206]</span>
some of its more obvious consequences. Southern
papers and southern resolution writers have a favorite
phrase, that if Congress shall pass any law against the
extension of slavery, they will resist it “at any and
every hazard.” Let us inquire, soberly, what a few
of these hazards are:—</p>

<p>First, as to the recovery, or non-recovery, of fugitive
slaves, which is one of the alleged provocatives
of dissolution. Take a map of the Southern States
and spread it out before you. Although they cover
an area of about nine hundred thousand square miles,
yet it is a very remarkable fact, that only an insignificantly
small portion of this vast extent lies more than
two hundred and fifty miles from a free frontier; and
those parts which do lie beyond this distance hold but
few slaves. Those portions of North Carolina, South
Carolina, Georgia, Alabama, and Tennessee, where
their upper boundaries converge among the mountains,
are a little more than this distance from a free border;
but this territory is relatively insignificant in size, and
sparsely populated with slaves. An outside belt or
border region of the slave states, no part of which
shall be more than one hundred miles from a free
frontier, would embrace nearly one half of their whole
area; and, as I suppose, much more than one half of
their whole slave population. What is to prevent the
easy escape of slaves living within these limits? While
God sends nights upon the earth, nothing can prevent it.
I venture to predict, that in such a state of things, slaves
will become cheap, and horses will become dear. I
am aware of your laws which forbid slaves to cross
bridges or ferries, without a pass; but you can have
no law against seasons of low water. The old adage
says, “riches have wings.” You will find that these
riches have legs. The Mississippi and Ohio Rivers,
where they border upon free states, will be alive as with
shoals of porpoises. Remember there is no constitution<span class="pagenum" id="Page_207">[Pg 207]</span>
of the United States now. That you have broken.
The free states are therefore absolved from all obligation
to surrender fugitives. The law of 1793 is
at an end. No action can be maintained for aiding
them to escape, nor for harboring or concealing them.
The distinguished senator from Kentucky, [Mr. <span class="smcap">Clay</span>,]
said, in his late speech, that no instance had ever come
to his knowledge where an action for harboring runaways
had not been maintained in the courts of the
free states, and damages recovered. But this remedy
you will have annulled. The constitution of the
United States, and the law of 1793, being at an end,
the law of nature revives. By this law, every case
of an escaping slave is but <i>the self-recovery of stolen
goods</i>. When they cross the line into a free state,
they are free,—as free as you or I. The states being
separated, I would as soon return my own brother or
sister into bondage, as I would return a fugitive slave.
Before God, and Christ, and all Christian men, they
are my brothers and sisters. As our laws make it piracy
to kidnap slaves in Africa, or to ship them thence,
so it shall be a felony, punishable with death, for any
southern master to kidnap a colored man, in a free
state, or transport him from it, on the ground of alleged
ownership. You are fond of quoting Scripture to us,
in justification of slavery. We will retort the Scripture,
that “he that stealeth a man, and selleth him, or
<i>if he be found in his hand</i>, he shall surely be put to
death.”</p>

<p>Here, then, is a free land frontier of about two
thousand miles, and a free ocean frontier of about
twenty-five hundred miles; and more than one half
of all your slaves are within two days’ run of it.
More than one quarter of them are within one night’s
run of it. Thousands and tens of thousands can
escape, even while you are dining. Canada, now so
distant, is brought five hundred miles nearer. The<span class="pagenum" id="Page_208">[Pg 208]</span>
under-ground railroad will be abandoned, and its stock
so invested as to yield quicker returns. What facilities
for escape, too, will the ocean present. Fleets of vessels
are constantly passing and repassing within a few
hours’ sail of the coast. The day for the power and the
triumph of those whom you hate as abolitionists will
have arrived. Steamboats could lie out of sight of
land in the day time, run in at night, and be out of
sight again before the rising of the sun. To guard
twenty-five hundred miles of coast is impossible. If
you declare war in order to avenge your losses, then
that war makes your coast lawfully accessible both by
day and by night, and multiplies a hundred fold the
opportunities and facilities for this self-recovery of
stolen goods.</p>

<p>I know it is said that some of the Northern States
are averse to the reception of blacks. Let us analyze
this idea. There are now by estimation three
millions of slaves. Say one half of these are either
too old or too young to have the strength or the intelligence
to escape. A million and a half are left; five
hundred thousand of these will have attachments to
their own parents or children, or to their masters, too
strong to be broken; or they may be so degraded as to
be contented with bondage; for their contentment is
always one of the measures of their degradation. This
would leave a million for fugitives, consisting wholly
of the most able bodied and intelligent. The Northern
States comprise a territory of five hundred thousand
square miles. A million of escaped slaves would give
but two to a square mile, and this surely would not be
a formidable number, even where colorphobia is
strongest. Suppose the case of a family of fourteen
slaves,—two grandparents, too decrepit for labor, six
athletic sons or daughters, and six grand children. What
but affection should prevent the able-bodied and the
profitable from escaping, and leaving the aged and the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_209">[Pg 209]</span>
young on their masters’ hands. Affection, indeed,
would bind the parents to their children, but they
know too well how often this bond is remorselessly
broken by the master; and, besides, an enlightened
affection would look to future children and their posterity
forever, as well as to those they already have.</p>

<p>Will you make your laws horribly penal, in order to
deter slaves from escaping by fear? Will you mutilate
them, or scourge them till within a minute of death?
Do so. All such punishments not only nourish the
love of freedom, but breed the purpose of revenge;
and it is a kind of lesson which a brutalized nature is
always prone to retaliate with improvements. Will
you make the act of escape a capital offence in a slave,
and destroy the victim you cannot restrain? Do so.
Though you may inflict death in a paroxysm of wrath,
yet of all your penal dispensations it is the most merciful.
It not only releases the slave himself, but is a
prospective and perpetual amnesty,—a true act of oblivion,—for
all his descendants. But this extremity
of punishment is not likely to be resorted to. In looking
over the criminal codes of the slave states, I think
I have noted cases where the slave is not punished
with death for an offence for which a white man is.
The <i>value</i> moderates the vengeance. There are not
many who, like Cleopatra, can afford to dissolve a pearl
in the cup of revenge, and swallow it at a draught,
when that pearl will command five hundred or a thousand
dollars in the market-place.</p>

<p>Southern gentlemen, when they threaten disunion,
cannot surely be so much at fault as to forget that slavery
exists here as it never existed before in the world.
In Greece there were slaves;—in some cases, highly
intelligent and accomplished slaves. They could have
escaped if they would; but where should they escape
to? All coterminous nations,—the whole circle
round,—were barbarians. These slaves, therefore,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_210">[Pg 210]</span>
had no place to flee to, where better institutions and
juster laws prevailed. So it was with Rome. Whither
could her slaves fly but to barbarous Spain, or more
barbarous Gaul, or to some nation whose language they
did not understand. Ignorance of language is a more
insuperable barrier than mountains or oceans. It is
just the reverse here. The English language is
spoken on all sides; and our slave land is encircled by
free land or free ocean,—Jamaica, the Bermudas, and
two thousand miles of northern frontier. And I have
lately seen an estimate from a credible source, that if
an inter-oceanic canal should be opened across the Isthmus
of Darien, twelve hundred ships would annually
pass through it; and, as they sail to and fro, they will
skirt the whole of your gulf coast, and the whole of
your Atlantic coast, a great part of the voyage being
within sight, or within a day’s sail, of your shores.
Now, the ignorant slave knows but little of geography,
but he would know of these avenues to freedom, and
nothing but death could extinguish such knowledge
and the hopes it would inspire. I say, sir, under such
circumstances, slavery would melt away upon your
borders like an iceberg in the tropics. The particles,
that is, the individuals of the exposed surface, would
disappear; and you might as well attempt to stop solar
evaporation by statutory laws, as to prevent their escape.
Perhaps a dissolution of the Union is the means
foreordained by God for the extinction of slavery; and
did I not foresee its doom before any very long period
shall have elapsed, without the unspeakable horrors of
a civil and a servile war, I cannot say to what conclusion
the above considerations would lead my own
mind.</p>

<p>Having shown how the “<i>redress</i>” of disunion will
operate upon one of the grievances alleged as its motive
and excuse, let us look at another of those “hazards,”
whose list, of indefinite length, the south is so<span class="pagenum" id="Page_211">[Pg 211]</span>
willing to brave. In case of rebellion or secession, to
whom will the territories belong? It is the rule of
political as well as of municipal law, that whoever retires
from a community, leaves its common property
behind him. I have a direct interest and proprietorship
in the church in my parish, in the schoolhouse
in my town, and in the state-house and other public
property belonging to my state. But if I expatriate
myself, I leave all that interest and proprietorship behind
me. If the county of Brooke, in Virginia, should
secede from the State of Virginia, and should annex
itself to Ohio or Pennsylvania, no one doubts that it
would forfeit all its rights to whatever public property
the State of Virginia possesses. In like manner, if the
“<i>United States South</i>”—as the new confederacy has
already been named by the “Richmond Enquirer,”—should
secede, they would, by the very act of secession,
surrender and abandon all right, title, and interest
in the new territories. By such secession, all their
citizens become foreigners. They have no rights under
the treaty with Mexico. The new Spanish citizen,
whose allegiance was transferred by the treaty
with Mexico, and whose citizenship is not yet two
years old, would have a right to expel them. The
“United States South,” it is true, may declare war,
and attempt the conquest of the territories by force;
but in such a contest, the army and navy and military
stores of the government, which, also, they have lost
by secession, will be turned against them. But, I
venture to prophesy, that if the slave states shall pass
through one war, single-handed, they will afterwards
be the most peaceable nation the world ever saw. To
every frontier country and to every naval power, they
have given three millions of hostages for their good
behavior.</p>

<p>Let us look at a third grievance they mean to redress,
and a third “hazard” they are ready to encounter.<span class="pagenum" id="Page_212">[Pg 212]</span>
They complain of northern agitation on the subject
of slavery, and northern instigation of the slaves
themselves. On the subject of “agitation,” I deny
that the north has ever overstepped the limits of their
constitutional rights. They have never agitated the
question of slavery in the states. It has been only in
regard to slavery in this District, or the annexation of
Texas, or the acquisition of territory for the extension
of slavery, or the imprisonment of her own citizens in
southern ports, or a denial of the inviolable right of
petition;—it has been only on such subjects that the
north has lifted up the voice of expostulation and remonstrance.
Even these constitutional rights she has
used forbearingly. She has never exerted force, nor
threatened force, either to maintain the right of petition
or to liberate her own citizens imprisoned in southern
jails.</p>

<p>In regard to instigating slaves to escape, I acknowledge
there have been some instances of it; but they
have been few. The perpetrators have been tried and
severely punished, and the north has acquiesced; for
they acknowledge that, if a man will go into a slave
state and violate its laws, he must be judged by them.
But I have never known of a single case,—I believe
there is no well-authenticated case on record,—where
a northern man has instigated the slaves to rise in
rebellion, and to retaliate upon their masters for the
wrongs which they and their race have suffered. As
I dread indiscriminate massacre and conflagration, I
should abhor the perpetrator of such a crime. But
will separation bring relief or security? No, sir; it
will enhance the danger a myriad fold. Thousands
will start up, who will think it as much a duty and an
honor to assist the slaves in any contest with their
masters, as to assist Greeks, or Poles, or Hungarians,
in resisting their tyrants. Two things exist at the
north which the south does not duly appreciate,—the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_213">[Pg 213]</span>
depth and intensity of our abhorrence of slavery, and
that reverence for the law which keeps it in check.
The latter counterpoises the former. We are a law-abiding
people. But release us from our obligations,
tear off from the bond with your own hands the signatures
which bind our consciences and repress our feelings,
destroy those compensations which the world and
which posterity would derive from a continuance of
this Union, and well may you tremble for the result.
I have seen fugitive slaves at the north, and heard from
their own lips the dreadful recital of their wrongs:
and if I am any judge of the natural language of men;
if I can divine from the outward expression what passions
are burning within, each one of them had a hundred
conflagrations and a hundred massacres in his
bosom. They felt as you and I should feel if we had
been subjected to Algerine bondage. And do you
doubt, sir, does any southern gentleman on this floor
doubt, for one moment, that if he were seized by a
Barbary corsair and sold into Algerine bondage, and
carried a hundred miles into the interior, that he would
improve the first opportunity to escape, though at every
step in his flight he should crush out a human life, and
should leave an ever-widening expanse of conflagration
behind him? If agitation and instigation are evils
now, woe to those who would seek to mitigate or to
repress them by the remedies of disunion and civil
war. Let men who live in a powder-mill beware how
they madden pyrotechnists.</p>

<p>But it is said that if dissolution occurs, the “United
States South” can form an alliance with Great Britain.
And are there no instigators and abolitionists in England?
Yes, sir, ten in England where there is one at
the north. Frederick Douglass has just returned from
England, where he has enjoyed the honors of an
ovation. William Wells Brown, another fugitive
slave, is now travelling in England. His journeys<span class="pagenum" id="Page_214">[Pg 214]</span>
from place to place are like the “progresses” of one
of the magnates of that land,—passing wherever he
will with free tickets, and enjoying the hospitalities
of the most refined and educated men. The very last
steamer brought out an account of his public reception
at Newcastle. An entertainment was given him which
was attended by four hundred ladies and gentlemen.
Men of high distinction and character adorned it by
their presence. The ladies made up a purse of twenty
sovereigns, which they gave him. It was presented in
a beautiful purse that one of their number,—the
successful competitor for the honor,—had wrought with
her own hands. All their generosity and kindness
they considered as repaid by hearing from his own lips
the pathetic story of his captivity and the heroism of
his escape. Sir, every man who has travelled in
England knows that there are large, wealthy, and refined
circles there, no member of which would allow
a slaveholder to sit at his table or enter his doors.
Not only churches, but moral and religious men, the
world over, have begun to read slaveholders out of
their communion and companionship. If the south
expects to rid itself of agitation and abolitionism by
rupturing its bonds with the north and substituting an
alliance with Great Britain for our present constitution,
they may envy the wisdom of the geese who invited
the fox to stand sentinel over them while they slept.
Northern interference will increase a hundred fold;
and the whole power and wealth of British abolitionism,
not only founded on moral principle but nursed
by national pride, will be brought to bear directly upon
them.</p>

<p>I said that the slave does not know much of geography;
but he understands enough of it to know
where lies the free frontier. The slave does not know
much of astronomy; but there is one star in the firmament
which is dearer to him than all the heavenly<span class="pagenum" id="Page_215">[Pg 215]</span>
host were to the Chaldeans. He worships the north
star with more than Persian idolatry. But let the
south form commercial alliances with Great Britain;
let the carrying trade be carried on in British vessels;
and the slave will find a star in the east as beautiful
to his eye, and as inspiring to his hopes, as the star in
the north.</p>

<p>Is the case of the <i>Amistad</i> forgotten, where a few
ignorant, degraded wretches, fresh from the jungles of
benighted Africa herself, seized upon the vessel in
which they were transported, and compelled the master,
under peril of his life, to steer for the north star,—that
light which God kindled in the heavens, and
which he will as soon extinguish as he will extinguish
the love of liberty which he has kindled in every
human breast?</p>

<p>And will a slave, escaping to Great Britain, or to
any of her colonial possessions, be reclaimable? Examine
Somerset’s case for an answer. No, sir. Neither
the third clause of the second section of the fourth
article of the constitution, nor the law of 1793, will
ever be extended over the Three Kingdoms or their
dependencies.</p>

<p>It surely is not beneath the dignity of the place or
the occasion to look at another of those “hazards”
which the south are invoking. They are proud of
their past history, and I doubt not their reflecting and
patriotic men are at least reasonably solicitous of their
future fame. When they meet in august council to
inaugurate the great event of establishing an independent
confederacy of slave states, and of dissolving
the political bands which now unite them with us,
“a decent respect to the opinions of mankind” will
“require them to declare the causes which had impelled
them to the separation.” And will they find a model
for their manifesto in that glorious Declaration of
American Independence which their own immortal<span class="pagenum" id="Page_216">[Pg 216]</span>
Jefferson prepared, and to which many of the greatest
of all their historic names are subscribed? Alas, they
will have to read that Declaration, as the devil reads
Scripture, backwards! I know not what may be the
rhetorical terms and phrases of the new Declaration,
but I do know that its <i>historic</i> form and substance
cannot be widely different from this:—</p>

<p>“We hold these truths to be self-evident, that men
are not created equal; that they are not endowed by
their Creator with inalienable rights; that white men,
of the Anglo-Saxon race, were born to rob, and tyrannize,
and enjoy, and black men, of the African
race, to labor, and suffer, and obey; that a man, with
a drop of African blood in his veins, has no political
rights, and therefore shall never vote; that he has no
pecuniary rights, and therefore whatever he may earn
or receive, belongs to his master; that he has no judicial
rights, and therefore he shall never be heard as a
witness to redress wrong, or violence, or robbery, committed
by white men upon him; that he has no parental
rights, and therefore his children may be torn
from his bosom, at the pleasure or caprice of his owner;
that he has no marital rights, and therefore his wife
may be lawfully sold away into distant bondage, or
violated before his eyes; that he has no rights of mind
or of conscience, and therefore he shall never be allowed
to read or to think, and all his aspirations for
improvement shall be extinguished; that he has no religious
rights, and therefore he shall never read the
Bible; that he has no heaven-descended, God-given
rights of freedom, and therefore he and his posterity
shall be slaves forever. We hold that governments
were instituted among men to secure and fortify this
ascendency of one race over another; that this ascendency
has its foundation in force ratified by law,
and in ignorance and debasement inflicted by intelligence
and superiority; and when any people, with<span class="pagenum" id="Page_217">[Pg 217]</span>
whom we are politically associated, would debar us
from propagating our doctrines or extending our domination
into new realms and over free territories, it becomes
our duty to separate from them, and to hold
them, as we hold the rest of mankind,—friends when
they make slaves, enemies when they make freemen.”</p>

<p>I say, sir, of whatever words and phrases the southern
“Magna Charta” may consist, this, or something
like this, must be its substance and reality.</p>

<p>So the preamble to their constitution must run in
this wise: “We, the people of the ‘United States
South,’ in order to form a more perfect conspiracy
against the rights of the African race, establish injustice,
insure domestic slavery, provide for holding three
millions of our fellow-beings, with all the countless
millions of their posterity, in bondage, and to secure
to ourselves and our posterity the enjoyment of power,
and luxury, and sloth, do ordain and establish this constitution
for the ‘United States South.’”</p>

<p>Sir, should a civil war ensue between the north and
the south, (which may God in his mercy avert,) in
consequence of an attempt to dissolve this Union, and
the certain resistance which would be made to such an
attempt, it would be difficult to exaggerate the immediate
evils which would befall the interests of New
England and some other parts of the north. Our manufactures
and our commerce would suffer at least a
temporary derangement. But we have boundless resources
in our enterprise and our intelligence. Knowledge
and industry are recuperative energies that can
never long be balked in their quest of prosperity. The
people that bore the embargo of 1807, and the war of
1812, when all their capital was embarked in commerce,
can survive any change that does not stop the
revolution of the seasons or suspend the great laws of
nature. And, when the day of peace again returns,
business will again return to its old channels. The<span class="pagenum" id="Page_218">[Pg 218]</span>
south, notwithstanding any personal hostility, will be
as ready to take northern gold as though it had come
from the English mint; and they will employ those
first, who will do their manufacturing or their commercial
labor cheapest and best. Gold is a great pacificator
between nations; and, in this money-loving age,
mutual interests will, in the end, subdue mutual hostilities.
Our share, therefore, of the calamities of a civil
war, will be mainly of a pecuniary nature. They
will not be intolerable. They will invade none of the
securities of home; they will not associate poison with
our daily food, nor murder and conflagration with our
nightly repose; nor black violation with the sanctities
of our daughters and our wives.</p>

<p>Even in a pecuniary point of view, a dissolution of
our political ties would cause less immediate and intense
suffering at the north than at the south. Our laws
and institutions are all framed so as to encourage the
poor man, and, by education, to elevate his children
above the condition of their parents; but their laws
and institutions all tend to aggrandize the rich, and to
perpetuate power in their hands. Were it not for the
visions of horror and of bloodshed which southern
threats have so intimately associated with this controversy,
one remarkable feature, which has hitherto been
eclipsed, would have been most conspicuous.</p>

<p>With every philanthropic northern man, a collateral
motive for keeping the new territories free is, that
they may be a land of hope and of promise to the poor
man, to whichever of all our states he may belong;
where he may go and find a home and a homestead
and abundance. But the south, in attempting
to open these territories to the slaveholders,
would give them to the rich alone,—would give them
to less than three hundred thousand persons out of a
population of six millions. The interests of the
poorer classes at the south all demand free territory,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_219">[Pg 219]</span>
where they can go and rise at once to an equality with
their fellow-citizens, which they never can do at home.
They are natural abolitionists, and unless blinded by
ignorance, or overawed by their social superiors, they
will so declare themselves. Every intelligent and
virtue-loving wife or mother, at the south, when she
thinks of her husband and her sons, is forced to be an
abolitionist. The attempt, therefore, to subject the
new territories to the law of slavery is not made in
the name of one half of the people of the United
States; it is not made for the six millions, more or
less, who inhabit the slave states; but it is made for
less than three hundred thousand slaveholders among
more than twenty millions of people.</p>

<p>There is one other “hazard,” sir, which the south
invokes and defies, which to her high-minded and
honor-loving sons, should be more formidable than all
the rest. She is defying the Spirit of the Age. She is
not only defying the judgment of contemporaries, but
invoking upon herself the execrations of posterity.
Mark the progress in the public sentiment of Christendom,
within the last few centuries, on the subject of
slavery and the rights of man. After the discovery of
this continent by Columbus, the ecclesiastics of Spain
held councils to discuss the question, whether the
aborigines of this country had or had not souls to be
saved. They left this question undecided; but they
said, as it was possible that the nations of the new
world might have an immortal spirit, they would send
them the gospel, so as to be on the safe side; and the
mission of Las Casas was the result. In the time of
Lord Coke, only a little more than two centuries ago,
the doctrine was openly avowed and held, in Westminster
Hall, that the heathen had no rights; and
therefore that it was lawful for Christians to drive
them out of their inheritance, and to despoil them, as
the Jews despoiled the Egyptians and drove out the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_220">[Pg 220]</span>
Canaanites. During the seventeenth century, all the
commercial nations of Europe engaged in the African
slave trade, without compunction or reproach. In the
last, or eighteenth century, the horrors of that trade were
aggravated and blackened by such demoniacal atrocities,
as, were it not for some redeeming attributes
among men, would have made the human race immortally
hateful. Even when our own constitution
was formed, in 1787, this dreadful traffic was not only
sanctioned, but a solemn compact was entered into, by
which all prohibition of it was prohibited for twenty
years. Yet, in the year 1820, after the lapse of only
thirty-three years, this very trade was declared to be
piracy,—the highest offence known to the law,—and
the felon’s death was denounced against all principals
and abettors. We are often reminded by gentlemen
of the south, that, at the time of the adoption of that
constitution, slavery existed in almost every state in
the Union; and that some northern merchants, by a
devilish alchemy, transmuted gold from its tears and
blood. But can they read no lesson as to the progress
of the age from the fact that all those states have since
abjured slavery of their own free will; and that, at the
present day, it would be more tolerable for any northern
merchant, rather than to be reasonably suspected
of the guilt of this traffic, to be cast into the fiery
furnace of Nebuchadnezzar, seven times heated? In
Europe, the tide of liberty, though meeting with obstructions
from firm-seated dynasties and time-strengthened
prerogative, still rises, and sweeps onward with
unebbing flow. In France, revolutions follow each
other in quicker and quicker succession. These revolutions
are only gigantic struggles of the popular will
to escape from oppression; and, at each struggle, the
giant snaps a chain.</p>

<p>Great Britain, which in former times sent more vessels
to the coast of Africa to kidnap and to transport its<span class="pagenum" id="Page_221">[Pg 221]</span>
natives, than all the other nations of the earth together,
now maintains a fleet upon the same coast to suppress
the trade she so lately encouraged. Three times, during
the present century, has that government escaped
civil commotion by making large concessions to popular
rights. Since the year 1814, written constitutions
have been extorted by the people from more than
three fourths of all the sovereigns of Europe. What
a tempest now beats upon Austria, from all points of
the compass, because, during the last season, she attempted
only to half enslave the Hungarians,—because
she attempted to do what, during the last century,
she might have done without a remonstrance!
The rights of individuals, not less than the rights of
communities, have emerged from oblivion into recognition,
and have become law. Penal codes have been
ameliorated, and barbarous customs abolished. There
are now but two places on the globe where a woman
can be publicly whipped,—in Hungary and in the
Southern States! And the universal scorn and hissing
with which the rulers of the former country have been
visited for their women-whipping, and their execution
of those whose sole crime was their love of freedom,
only foretoken that fiercer scorn and louder hissing
with which, from all sides of the civilized world, the
latter will soon be visited. Let the high-toned and
chivalrous sons of the south,—those “who feel a stain
upon their honor like a wound,”—think of all this, as
one in the long catalogue of “hazards” upon which
they are rushing.</p>

<p>Sir, the leading minds in a community are mainly
responsible for the fortunes of that community. Under
God, the men of education, of talent, and of attainment,
turn the tides of human affairs. Where
great social distinctions exist, the intelligence and the
wealth of a few stimulate or suppress the volition of
the masses. They are the sensorium of the body<span class="pagenum" id="Page_222">[Pg 222]</span>
politic, and their social inferiors are the mighty limbs,
which, for good or for evil, they wield. Such is the
relation in which the three hundred thousand, or less
than three hundred thousand slave owners of the south,
hold to their fellow-citizens. They can light the torch
of civil war, or they can quench it. But if civil war
once blazes forth, it is not given to mortal wisdom to
extinguish or control it. It comes under other and
mightier laws, under other and mightier agencies.
Human passions feed the combustion; and the flame
which the breath of man has kindled, the passions of
the multitude,—stronger than the breath of the hurricane,—will
spread. Among these passions, one of
the strongest and boldest is the love of liberty, which
dwells in every bosom. In the educated and civilized,
this love of liberty is a regulated but paramount desire;
in the ignorant and debased, it is a wild, vehement
instinct. It is an indestructible part of the nature
of man. Weakened it may be, but it cannot be
destroyed. It is a thread of asbestos in the web of the
soul, which all the fires of oppression cannot consume.</p>

<p>With the creation of every human being, God creates
this love of liberty anew. The slave shares it with his
master, and it has descended into his bosom from the
same high source. Whether dormant or wakeful, it
only awaits an opportunity to become the mastering
impulse of the soul. Civil war is that opportunity.
Under oppression it bides its time. Civil war is the
fulness of time. It is literal truth that the south fosters
within its homes three millions of latent rebellions.
Imbedded in a material spontaneously combustible, it
laughs at fire. Has it any barriers to keep the spirit of
liberty, which has electrified the Old World, from crossing
its own borders, and quickening its bondmen into
mutinous life?—not all of them, but one in ten thousand,
one in a hundred thousand of them. If there is
no Spartacus among them, with his lofty heroism and<span class="pagenum" id="Page_223">[Pg 223]</span>
his masterly skill for attack and defence, is the race of
Nat Turners extinct, who, in their religious musings,
and their dumb melancholy, take the impulses of their
own passions for the inspiration of God, and, after
prayer and the eucharist, proceed to massacre and conflagration?
In ignorant and imbruted minds, a thousand
motives work which we cannot divine. A
thousand excitements madden them, which we cannot
control. It may be a text of Scripture, it may be the
contents of a wine vault; but the result will be the
same,—havoc wherever there is wealth, murder
wherever there is life, violation wherever there is
chastity. Let this wildfire of a servile insurrection
break out in but one place in a state; nay, in but ten
places, or in five places in all the fifteen states; and
then, in all their length and breadth, there will be no
more quiet sleep. Not Macbeth, but the angel of retribution,
will “murder sleep.” The mother will clasp
her infant to her breast, and, while she clasps it, die a
double death. But, where will the slaves find arms?
“<i>Furor arma ministrat.</i>” Rage will supply their
weapons. Read the history of those slaves who have
escaped from bondage; mark their endurance and their
contrivance, and let incredulity cease forever. They
have hid themselves under coverts; dug holes and burrowed
in the earth for concealment; sunk themselves
in ponds, and sustained life by breathing through a
reed, until their pursuers had passed by; wandered
in “Dismal Swamps,” far away from the habitations of
men; almost fasting for forty days and forty nights,
like Christ in the wilderness; crushed themselves into
boxes, but of half a coffin’s dimensions, to be nailed
up and transported hundreds of miles, as merchandise;
and, in this horrible condition, have endured
hunger and thirst, and, standing upon the head, without
a groan or a sigh;—and, will men, who devise
such things, and endure such things, be balked in their
purposes of hope and of revenge, when the angel of<span class="pagenum" id="Page_224">[Pg 224]</span>
destruction, in the form of the angel of liberty, descends
into their breasts?</p>

<p>The state of slavery is always a state of war. In
its deepest tranquillity, it is but a truce. Active hostilities
are liable at any hour to be resumed. Civil war
between the north and the south,—any thing that
brings the quickening idea of freedom home to the
mind of the slave; that supplies him with facilities of
escape, or immunities for revenge,—will unleash the
bloodhounds of insurrection. Can you muster armies
in secret, and march them in secret, so that the slave
shall not know that they are mustered and marched to
perpetuate his bondage, and to extend the bondage of
his race? Was not Major Dade’s whole command
supposed to be massacred through the treachery of a
slave? A foray within your borders places you in
such a relation to the slave that you are helpless without
him, and in danger of assassination with him. He
that defends slavery by war, wars against the eternal
laws of God, and rushes upon the thick bosses of
Jehovah’s buckler. Such are some of the “hazards”
which the leaders of public opinion at the south, the
legislators and guides of men in this dark and perilous
hour, are invoking upon themselves and their fellows;
not for the interests of the whole, but for the fancied
interests of the slaveholders alone, and against the real
interest of a vast majority of the people. May God
give that wisdom to the followers which he seems not
yet to have imparted to the leaders.</p>

<p>Sir, in these remarks, I have studiously abstained
from every thing that seemed to me like retaliation or
unkindness. I certainly have suffered no purposed
word of crimination to pass my lips. If I have uttered
severe truths, I have not sought for severe language
in which to clothe them. What I have said, I
have said as to a brother sleeping on the brink of a
precipice, where one motion of his troubled sleeping,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_225">[Pg 225]</span>
or of his bewildered awaking, might plunge him into
remediless ruin.</p>

<p>In conclusion, I have only to add, that such is my
solemn and abiding conviction of the character of
slavery, that under a full sense of my responsibility to
my country and my God, I deliberately say, better
disunion,—better a civil or a servile war,—better any
thing that God in his providence shall send, than an
extension of the bounds of slavery.</p>

<p>Upon the close of Mr. Mann’s remarks,</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Mr. Burt</span>, of South Carolina, rose and said that he
had not interrupted the gentleman from Massachusetts
during his speech, but he presumed he did not wish to
have any error go forth under the sanction of his
name; and he therefore called upon him to retract
what he had said in regard to slaves ever being exempted
from capital punishment for crimes for which
the whites were executed. He called upon him also
to withdraw the imputation that the pecuniary value
of the slave was a motive for any such difference in
the laws respecting them. He remarked that, by the
laws of the Southern States, such a distinction is not
made. I know, said he, no instance in which it
exists. On the contrary, slaves are punished capitally
for offences that are not so punished when committed
by white men. In South Carolina, slaves have never
been admitted to the benefit of clergy for offences at
common law; and thus a slave is punished capitally
for maiming or grievously beating a white man. Mr.
Burt was also understood to say that there were “six
or eight,” or “eight or ten,” offences in South Carolina
for which slaves were punished capitally, but for
which white men were not.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Mr. Mann</span> replied that he had stated what he believed
to be true; but if he had fallen into any mistake,
he should be most happy to be corrected. He
was assured also by the gentleman from Georgia, on<span class="pagenum" id="Page_226">[Pg 226]</span>
his left, [Mr. <span class="smcap">Toombs</span>,] that no such distinction existed
as he had supposed; and it was but reasonable to
believe that those gentlemen were more conversant
with the southern laws than himself.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Mr. Mann</span> added that he, (Mr. Mann,) could not be
expected to have the statute books of the Southern
States before him, at that time, to meet so unexpected
a denial. Neither could he be expected by any honorable
gentleman to make a retraction until he had time
to see whether the ground he had taken were tenable.</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p><span class="smcap">Note by Mr. Mann.</span> On repairing to the Law library to ascertain
which party was right in regard to the above difference of opinion, the
second book I opened contained at least three cases, where the courts
were authorized to sentence a slave to be transported for the commission
of an offence, for which a white man must be unconditionally
hung. See North Carolina Rev. Stat. vol. i. chap. 3, §§ 36, 37, 39.
Of course, the reason of this difference is the pecuniary value of the
slave. Hung, he would be worthless; transported to Cuba, he might
bring five hundred dollars.</p>

<p>The law was formerly so in Mr. Burt’s own state.</p>

<p>In the seventh volume of the Statutes at Large of South Carolina,
No. 344, § 5, I find the following: “And <i>whereas</i>, it has been found
by experience that the execution of several negroes for felonies of a
smaller nature, by which they have been condemned to die, has been
of great charge and expense to the public, and will continue, (if some
remedy be not found,) to be very chargeable and burdensome to this
province; <i>Be it therefore enacted</i>, by the authority aforesaid, that all
negroes or other slaves who shall be convicted and found guilty of
any capital crime, (murder excepted,) for which they used to receive
the sentence of death, as the law directs, shall be transported from
this province, by the public receiver for the time being, to any other
of his majesty’s plantations, or other foreign part, where he shall
think fitting to send them, <i>for the use of the public</i>.”</p>

<p>The slave condemned to transportation was to be appraised, and
his master paid out of the public treasury, and this amount was, of
course, to be reimbursed by what should be received from the foreign
sale. From the statement of Mr. Burt, that no such law <i>now</i> exists
in South Carolina, I suppose the above enactment must have been
repealed.</p>

<p>The <i>fact</i> stated in the speech is therefore proved, although the
instances may be fewer than I had supposed. As to the motive
attributed, there can be no doubt. The cases are most numerous in
the Southern States, where white men are merely <i>imprisoned</i> for
offences for which slaves are whipped, branded, and cropped, or
otherwise corporally punished. The slave’s time is too valuable to<span class="pagenum" id="Page_227">[Pg 227]</span>
be lost in a prison, but the white man’s is not; the white man’s skin
is too sacred to be flayed or branded, but the slave’s is not.</p>

<p>But laws which punish “<i>six or eight</i>,” or “<i>eight or ten</i>,” or any
other number of offences with death, when committed by slaves,
while the same offences receive a milder penalty when committed by
whites; or laws denying the benefit of clergy, (where that relic of
barbarism still prevails,) to a slave, while it is granted to a white
man, are surely among the greatest atrocities recorded in the history
of the race. Ponder for a moment upon the accursed fact. A freeman
acting under all the motives to self-respect; moved by all the
incentives to good conduct; enjoying all the means of education;
inspired by all the influences of the gospel; and capable of comprehending
all the powerful restraints and the sublime rewards connected
with a hereafter, <i>exonerated</i> from the punishment of death; while
death, in all the horrors with which ignorance and superstition can
invest it, is inflicted upon men who are subjected to bondage; deprived
of all motive for honorable conduct; debarred from every
avenue to knowledge by cruel penalties; blinded to the light of the
gospel; and, in a land of boasted Christianity, left in the darkness
of heathenism! These are not the customs of a lawless banditti, of
outcasts or renegades, but solemn enactments of state legislatures,
devised by talent and eminence, enforced and preserved by the oligarchical
few, by the virtual nobility and flower of populous communities.
Such laws demand a return of five talents, under penalty of
death, where only one talent had been confided; they absolve him
who had received five talents, though he brings none of them back.
Such laws make the Scriptures read, that the servant who knoweth
his lord’s will, but doeth it not, shall be beaten with but few stripes;
but the servant who did not know it, whom his very master debarred
from knowing it, shall be beaten with many stripes; for unto whomsoever
much is given, but little shall be required; but to whom men
have committed much, of him little shall be asked. What shall be
thought of a system, <span class="allsmcap">AND OF EXTENDING A SYSTEM</span>, which so perverts
the hearts of men, otherwise clear-headed, high-minded, and generous!</p>

<p>What more fitting theme could be conceived, were the arch-enemy
of mankind to compose a <i>burlesque</i>, in ridicule of <i>Republics</i>, to be
represented in that Theatre which is all “<i>Pit</i>”?</p>

<p>It is not, however, the <i>existence</i> of slavery, but its <i>extension</i>, we
now intend to avert.</p>
</div>

<hr class="tb">

<p>The last paragraph in the foregoing speech gave rise to
the following correspondence, which was published in the
National Intelligencer:—</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_228">[Pg 228]</span></p>


<p class="center caption">LETTER FROM MR. MANN.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Messrs. Editors</span>; Your paper of this morning contains a portion of
a speech of the Hon. <span class="smcap">Mr. Badger</span>, of North Carolina, delivered
in the Senate on the 19th instant, in which he comments upon some
remarks lately made by me in the House of Representatives. The
respect which, (without any personal acquaintance,) I have long entertained
for this distinguished senator, would deter me from noticing
any such miscontructions of my remarks as a candid mind might inadvertently
commit; but the misrepresentations which the senator has
made are so gratuitous and gross, that I am constrained to notice them.
I therefore ask the favor of a place in your paper, where he can answer
me, if he pleases, though he chose a place for his animadversions where
he knew I could not answer him.</p>

<p>The following is a passage in his speech:—</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>“Nor, Mr. President, must I forget that, in considering the effect which
this proviso is likely to have upon the condition of the southern mind, we
must look to what has been said by northern gentlemen in connection with
this subject. Permit me to call the attention of the Senate to a very brief extract
from a speech delivered in the other end of the capitol:—</p>

<p>“‘In conclusion, I have only to add, that such is my solemn and abiding
conviction of the character of slavery, that, under a full sense of my responsibility
to my country and my God, I deliberately say, better disunion, better
a civil or a servile war, better any thing that God in his providence shall send,
than an extension of the bounds of slavery.’</p>

<p>“<span class="smcap">Several Senators.</span> Whose speech is that?</p>

<p>“<span class="smcap">A Senator.</span> Mr. Mann’s.</p>

<p>“<span class="smcap">Mr. Badger.</span> We have heard much, Mr. President, of the violence of
southern declamation. I have most carefully avoided reading the speeches of
southern gentlemen who were supposed to be liable to that charge. I happened,
however, in the early part of this session, and before the other House
was organized, to be in that body when there were some bursts of feeling and
denunciation from southern gentlemen, which I heard with pain, mortification,
almost with anguish of mind. But, sir, these were bursts of feeling; these
were passionate and excited declarations; these had every thing to plead for
them as being spontaneous and fiery ebullitions of men burning at the moment
under a sense of wrong. And where, among these, will you find any thing
equal to the cool, calm, deliberate announcement of the philosophic mind
that delivered in the other House the passage which I have read: ‘Better disunion,
better a civil or a servile war, better any thing that God in his providence
shall send, than an extension of the bounds of slavery.’</p>

<p>“In other words, it is the deliberate, settled, fixed opinion of the honorable
gentleman who made that speech, that rather than the extension of slavery
<i>one foot</i>,—yes sir, there is no qualification, <i>one foot</i>,—he would prefer a
disunion of these states; he would prefer all the horrors of civil war, all the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_229">[Pg 229]</span>
monstrous, untold, and almost inconceivable atrocities of a servile war; he
would pile the earth with dead; he would light up heaven with midnight conflagrations;
all this, yea, and more,—all the vials of wrath which God in his
providence might see fit to pour down upon us, he would suffer, rather than
permit, not one man who is now free to be made a slave,—that would be
extravagant enough,—but rather than permit one man who now stands upon
the soil of North Carolina a slave, to stand a slave upon the soil of New
Mexico:</p>

<p>“Yes, sir, here is a sacrifice of life and happiness, and of all that is dear to
the black and white races together, to a mere idealism,—a sacrifice proposed
by a gentleman who claims to be a philosopher, and to speak the language of
calm deliberation,—a sacrifice of our glorious Union proposed by a patriot,—not
rather than freemen should be made slaves,—not rather than the condition
of even one human being should be made worse than it now is,—but
rather than one man shall remove from one spot of the earth to another without
an improvement of his condition, without passing from slavery to freedom.
Sir, after that announcement, thus made, which I beg to say, sir, I did not
seek,—for the speech I have never read; the extract I found in one of the
newspapers of the day,—after that announcement, talk not of southern violence,
talk not of southern egotism, talk not of our disposition to sacrifice to
our peculiar notions and our peculiar relations, the peace and happiness, the
growing prosperity, and the mutual concord of this great Union. Now, sir, if
that announcement goes abroad into the southern country, attended by the
wanton application of this Wilmot proviso, an irritating commentary upon that
patriotic announcement, what can be expected? What but the deepest emotions
of indignation in the bosoms of those born and brought up where
slavery exists, and taking totally different views of the institution from those
which are taken by the honorable gentleman who has placed himself upon
this cool and deliberate, humane and philosophical position.”</p>

<p>By his own confession, Mr. Badger had not read my speech. He
takes up a single sentence, therefore, for comment, without the justice
of looking at the context. He is like the man who should declare
that the Scriptures say “there is no God,” when it is the fool, and not
the Bible, that makes the declaration. My speech discussed the question
of extending slavery over our territories and the proposed southern
remedy for prohibiting that extension, namely, the disunion of the
states. The conclusion to which I came was, that the north had better
submit to the application of the southern remedy, than to surrender
the new territories to all the horrors of bondage. Beyond our
present limits “no more slave territories and no more slave states,”
was the exact ground I took. But Mr. Badger represents me as saying
that I would “prefer a disunion of these states,” and all the other
evils in his long and labored catalogue, “rather than the extension of
slavery <i>one foot</i>;” “yes,” he repeats with emphasis, “<i>one foot</i>.” Now,
I never made such a declaration as this. I never said any thing to give
countenance or color to such a declaration. Many persons, seeing the
statement of the honorable senator, and relying upon his character
for fairness and veracity, have believed that I did. But he has led
them into the error. My argument and conclusion had reference to
new slave territories, or to a new slave territory. Mr. Badger construes,
or rather misconstrues this to mean “one foot.” If my speech
is fairly susceptible of this construction, I wish so far to retract it. He
shall have my consent to a “<i>one foot</i>” territory, and to as many slaves
as he can hold on it under the <i>local law</i>.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_230">[Pg 230]</span></p>

<p>Mr. Badger further charges me with invoking all the calamities he
enumerates, “rather than permit one man who now stands upon the
soil of North Carolina a slave, to stand a slave upon the soil of New
Mexico.” This statement is not merely forced, but fabricated. Surely
I said no such thing. I intimated nor hinted at, nor thought of such
a thing. There may be little choice whether any one man who now
“stands a slave,” shall “stand a slave” in one place or in another, <i>if
that be all</i>. In a national point of view, and looking at the subject
as a statesman, the sentiment imputed to me is simply ridiculous.
But this wrongful imputation of such a sentiment, without substance
or semblance to justify it, is far worse than ridiculous; it becomes
unjust and ungenerous; and is none the less so for being made in a
place where he knew I could not repel it. The whole scope and stress
of my argument went against yielding any such portion of our new
acquisitions to slavery as would form either a state or a territory.
The eight or ten southern legislatures, the eight or ten governors of
southern states, the southern Senators and Representatives in Congress,
and the confederates in getting up the Nashville Convention,
have never, to my knowledge, proposed a compromise on the platform
of a “<i>one foot</i>” territory, or expressed their readiness to spare the
Union if “one man who stands a slave in North Carolina,” is permitted
to “stand a slave in New Mexico.” When such an issue is
brought forward seriously, it will be met seriously. But the real
issue on this point is, (and the senator must know it,) whether the
victims of slavery shall be indefinitely multiplied by the addition to
its domain of regions now free. That the creation of a new slave territory
will increase the victims of slavery, is a proposition too plain
to be argued. To deny this, is to assert that if slavery had been
confined to the State of Virginia, or to the settlement at Jamestown,
where the first cargo of slaves was landed, the present number of
slaves in this country would be no less than it now is; or, in other
words, there would now be three millions of slaves within the limits
of Virginia, or within the limits of Jamestown.</p>

<p>I have made this reply to the honorable senator from North Carolina
with great reluctance, and from no motive of personal unkindness.
I have long been accustomed to regard his character with
respect, and his opinions with deference; and I am happy in an opportunity
to express a feeling of personal gratitude for his former
endeavors to avert from the councils of the nation the subject-matter
of this most lamentable contention.</p>

</p>

<p>P. S. Another point in the honorable senator’s speech, in which
he attempts to vindicate the penal slave code of North Carolina and
of the other Southern States from the taint of cupidity, may be safely
left without comment to intelligent men. Every student of the <i>criminal</i>
legislation of the Southern States in regard to slaves, knows that
their laws are replete with proofs where the sensibilities of a man are
sacrificed to the spirit of gain.</p>

<div class="footnotes"><h3>FOOTNOTES:</h3>

<div class="footnote">

<p><a id="Footnote_8" href="#FNanchor_8" class="label">[8]</a> In February, 1847, Mr. Calhoun offered a series of resolutions
in the Senate of the United States, among which was the following:—</p>

<p>“<i>Resolved</i>, That it is a fundamental principle in our political creed,
that a people, in forming a constitution, have the unconditional right
to form and adopt the government which they may think best calculated
to secure their liberty, prosperity and happiness; and, in conformity
thereto, no other condition is imposed by the Federal Constitution
on a state, in order to be admitted into this Union, except that
its constitution shall be “republican;” and that the imposition of
any other by Congress would not only be in violation of the constitution,
but in direct conflict with the principle on which our political
system rests.”</p>

<p>In sustaining these resolutions, he said,—</p>

<p>“Sir, I hold it to be a fundamental principle of our political system
that the people have a right to establish what government they may
think proper for themselves; that every state <span class="allsmcap">ABOUT</span> to become a
member of this Union has a right to <span class="allsmcap">FORM ITS OWN GOVERNMENT AS
IT PLEASES</span>; and that, in order to be admitted, there is but one qualification,
and that is, that the government shall be republican. There
is no express provision to that effect, but it results from that important
section which guaranties to every state in this Union a republican
form of government.”</p>

<p>Mr. Senator Downs, of Louisiana, offered the following resolution:—</p>

<p>“<i>Resolved</i>, That it is competent and expedient, and not inconsistent
with the practice of the government in some cases, to admit California,
or such portion of it as Congress may deem proper, immediately
into the Union, on an equal footing with the other states; and that
the committee on —— be instructed to report a bill for that purpose,
for that portion of California which lies west of the summit of
the Sierra Nevada mountains.”</p>

<p>The doctrine of these resolutions was fully indorsed by the Washington
<i>Union</i>, speaking, doubtless, (for it never spoke any thing else,)
the sentiments of the then administration.</p>

<p>“The south denies that Congress has any jurisdiction over the
subject of slavery, and contends that the <i>people of the territories alone</i>,
when they frame a constitution, preparatory to admission into the
Union, <i>have a right to speak and be heard on that matter</i>. This fact
being settled, <i>it really seems to us that this exciting question might be
speedily adjusted</i>, if calm counsels prevail. The south contends for her
honor, and for the great principles of non-intervention and state equality. <i>Why, then, cannot all unite, and permit California to come
into the Union as soon as she can frame a constitution?</i> Then, according
to the doctrines which prevail on both sides of Mason’s and
Dixon’s line, she may constitutionally establish her domestic institutions
on any basis consistent with republican principles. <i>The south
could lose nothing by adopting this course. On the contrary, she would
save all for which she contends.</i>”</p>

</div>

<div class="blockquot">

<p><span class="smcap">To the Editors of the National Intelligencer</span>;</p>

<p>A communication in your paper of yesterday, from the Hon.
<span class="smcap">Horace Mann</span>, of the House of Representatives, seems to require a
brief notice from me.</p>

<p>The honorable gentleman accuses me of having treated him with
gross injustice in a recent speech, in which I referred to the closing
paragraph of a speech of his, and made some comments thereupon.</p>

<p>Now, in what consists the injustice? I quoted that paragraph
from his speech, and he does not deny that it was quoted truly.
There is not a word or syllable attributed to him, not a word or syllable
alleged or insinuated to have been spoken by him, except that
paragraph, and that he admits was spoken and printed by him just
as I quoted it. Then, in the statement of his language, I have done
him no injustice.</p>

<p>In my comments, I gave “in other words,”—in my own words,—what
I deemed a true interpretation of his; and, as I attributed to
him no language which he did not use; as every thing to which he
objects is, and upon the face of my remarks plainly purports to be,
merely my own commentary upon the single quotation correctly taken
from the gentleman’s speech, it is very obvious that I have “fabricated”
nothing. Whether the interpretation given to the honorable
gentleman’s language be correct or incorrect, a just carrying of it out
to its true results, or an unfair exaggeration, intelligent men will be
able to decide from the reading of my speech, which presents together
both the text and the commentary, and to them I am willing
to leave it.</p>

<p>But the gentleman says that in his speech he “discussed the question
of extending slavery over our territories,” and that “no more
slave territories and no more slave states was the exact ground” he
took. And what has that to do with the matter of his complaint
against me? I referred not to his discussion, or the grounds taken
in it. I was not considering the course or validity of his reasoning,
but the conclusion at which he arrived. That was set down in his
speech in these words:—</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>“In conclusion, I have only to add, that such is my solemn and abiding
conviction of the character of slavery, that, under a full sense of my responsibility
to my country and my God, I deliberately say, better disunion,—better
a civil or a servile war,—better any thing that God in his providence shall
send, than <i>an extension of the bounds of slavery</i>.”</p>
</div>

<p>Here is no reference to any particular degree, kind, or manner of
extending slavery. He speaks not of the “proposed or desired extension,”
of “extension into our territories,” or even of “<i>the</i> extension,”<span class="pagenum" id="Page_232">[Pg 232]</span>
but he speaks of “an extension of the bounds of slavery,”
without a reference to any thing in the speech or elsewhere by which
the generality of his language might be modified or explained. To
refer, therefore, to the speech in order to understand the import of
this general conclusion, is idle. If the reasoning in the speech be
particular, and the deduction general, there would be the logical defect
of a conclusion too large for the premises, but the <i>meanings</i> of
the conclusion would remain, and the want of reasoning to support
it would not abate aught of its unmitigated and sweeping generality.</p>

<p>It is evident, then, that, whether supported by any reasoning, particular
or general, the gentleman’s conclusion remains, that disunion,
civil war, servile war, with certain undefined judgments of Heaven
besides, are preferable to “an extension of the bounds of slavery;”
but the indefinite article “an” is here exactly equivalent to “any,”
and therefore whatever amounts to “any extension,” however small,—a
square mile, or acre, or foot,—is strictly within the meaning of
the language which he has thought proper deliberately to retain in
his printed speech.</p>

<p>But I accept willingly the explanation now given of his meaning,
and only regret that, when writing out his speech, he did not then
give the explanation which converts his general into a particular
proposition. By this explanation I learn that, in his conclusion, he
meant to speak not of any extension, however small, but of an extension
of slavery in our territories.</p>

<p>Then the gentleman’s conclusion, as modified by himself, will be
thus: “Better disunion,” [the dissolution of our government and
destruction of the Union formed by our fathers;] “better a civil or
a servile war,” [the most disastrous, ferocious, and cruel of all wars;]
“better any thing that God in his providence shall send,” [for example,
pestilence and famine;] “than an extension of the bounds of
slavery” over our territories!</p>

<p>I cheerfully submit to all “intelligent men,” if they are at the same
time humane and patriotic, to pass upon such a sentiment. To his
own intelligent, patriotic, and humane constituents, I submit it, with
entire confidence that it will not meet their approval; but, on the
contrary, that they will regard the honorable gentleman as having
been betrayed by the pervading excitement on the slavery question,
into an extravagant,—I will not say fanatical,—declaration, which
he is not able to defend, or willing, as yet, to retract or qualify.</p>

<p>I had believed that the honorable gentleman had, under the exciting
influence of discussion, unconsciously done injustice to my
own state, but a remark added to his communication would perhaps
justify me, if inclined to judge unkindly, in supposing that the
wrong was wilful. But I am not so inclined, and draw no such conclusion.
I infer, rather, that the bewildering excitement under which
the speech was made has not yet passed away, but still continues to
influence unfavorably the otherwise clear understanding and fair and
upright purposes of the honorable gentleman.</p>

<h3>MR. MANN’S REJOINDER.</h3>

<div class="blockquot">

<p><span class="smcap">Messrs. Editors</span>; Your paper of this morning contains a communication
from the Hon. Mr. <span class="smcap">Badger</span>, in reply to mine of the
29th ultimo. I ask your indulgence while I briefly answer him.</p>

<p>My complaint was, that he had taken half a dozen lines from my
speech, and had attributed a meaning to them, in some respects odious,
in other respects ridiculous, and in all respects unwarrantable. By
his own admission, too, he had done this without reading the speech
itself; when, had he accorded to me the justice of hearing me before
he condemned me, he would have found that both subject-matter and
context confuted his interpretation.</p>

<p>His first reply is, that he did not “attribute” to me “a word” nor
“a syllable” which I did not use; and, repeating himself, he adds,
that he did not “allege” or “insinuate” a “word” nor “a syllable”
that I now deny. In view of this he asks, with an air of triumph,
“In what consists the injustice?”</p>

<p>I answer, as before; the injustice consists in giving a false meaning
to true “words” and “syllables,”—a meaning which both the subject-matter
and context of my speech repudiate. I do not see that it is
less unjustifiable to attach false meanings to words correctly quoted,
than to forge quotations. Surely, the honorable senator is too good a
lawyer to be ignorant of the maxim, “<i>qui hæret in litera</i>” &amp;c.; and
too good a theologian not to have read that “the letter killeth” if divorced
from the spirit. When Beaumont and Fletcher were closeted
together to devise the plan of one of their joint plays, in which a
king was to be killed, they were severally overheard to say, “I will
kill the king,” and “I will kill the king;” whereupon they were arrested,
transported to London, and arraigned for conspiring the death
of the reigning sovereign. Suppose them to have been convicted of
treason and gibbeted; could not the perjured informer, with a charming
and childlike simplicity, have used the exact language of Mr.
<span class="smcap">Badger</span>, and said, I testified to the exact “<i>words</i>” and “<i>syllables</i>.”
“In what consists the injustice?”</p>

<p>But the honorable senator goes on to say, that he had no concern
with my <i>speech</i>, but only with my <i>conclusion</i>. His language is, “I
was not considering the course or validity of his reasoning, but the
conclusion at which he arrived.” He then repeats the quotation, and
adds, “To refer, therefore, to the speech in order to understand the
import of this conclusion, is idle.”</p>

<p>With all deference to the senator,—and mine is unfeignedly great,—I
submit that this is false logic and worse ethics. As well may
one declare the judgment of a court to be legal or illegal, merciful or
tyrannous, without looking back to the allegations and proofs on
which it is founded. As well may one affirm or deny the “Q. E. D.”<span class="pagenum" id="Page_234">[Pg 234]</span>
of the geometer, without reference to the problem or demonstration
to which it is subjoined. When a discussion exists respecting “<i>an extension
of the bounds of slavery</i>,” (and these were my words,) and I say
that I would prefer certain enumerated evils rather than the extension
in controversy, it surely becomes all-important to know whether that
extension is to embrace the whole earth and to extend through all
time, or whether it is only the addition of one atom or granule to existing
slave territory, or of one respiration, or one heart-beat of an
existing slave, on territory now free. I affirm, then, that a knowledge
of the premises <i>is</i> indispensable to a judgment on the conclusion.</p>

<p>But he accepts my explanation, and then appeals from me to what
he is pleased to call, (and I thank him for the justice that prompted
the well-deserved compliment,) my “intelligent, patriotic, and humane
constituents,”—“with entire confidence that it will not meet their
approval.” I gladly join in this appeal. As “<i>intelligent</i>” men, my
constituents foresee that the extension of slavery over our territories
will not only be an unspeakable crime in itself, but will be converted
into the means of future unspeakable crimes in further extensions.
As “<i>patriotic</i>” men, they prefer to bear any calamity that may
come upon themselves, rather than to devolve accumulated calamities,
growing out of their own dereliction from duty, upon their posterity.
As “<i>humane</i>” men, they would deprecate and forefend that greatest
of inhumanities, the dooming of increased thousands and millions
of their fellow-men to the dreadful inheritance of bondage. And as
religious men,—as men who “tremble when they reflect that God is
just, and that his justice will not sleep forever,”—they mean to use
all constitutional means to arrest the slave-creating and slave-extending
policy of this government, let the two or three hundred thousand
slaveholders among our twenty millions of people do what they
will.</p>

<p>That the bearings of the subject may be rightly understood, it
should be remembered that my speech was made on the 15th of February,
after ten weeks of threatened disunion on certain specified and
not improbable contingencies. “My conclusion,” therefore, was not
<i>aggressive</i>, but <i>submissive</i>. I only declared which branch of their
proffered alternative I should prefer.</p>

<p>The closing paragraph of the respected senator’s communication alludes
to the <i>motives</i> of those wide and painful differences which are
made between the whites and the slaves in the <i>criminal</i> legislation of
the Southern States. Nothing could be more edifying, as to the demoralizing
nature of slavery and its effects upon men, who, like the
senator, are otherwise honorable and generous, than a comparison of
the two codes of law and the two systems of jurisprudence which the
rulers have respectively established for themselves and for their bondmen.
The laws or customs known to civilized men and to barbarians
are not more diverse. It would be rash and reckless in me to encounter
the distinguished senator on any other subject; but on this I
would say, as was said by a knight in an old tournament, that he had
such confidence in the justness of his cause that he would give his
adversary the advantage of sun and wind.</p>

<p>To the Hon. James Richardson, I. Cleveland, and John Gardner, of

</div>

<p>
<span class="smcap">Gentlemen</span>;<br>
</p>

<p>Having been called home on account of sickness
in my family, I have just received, at this place, your
kind invitation to meet and address my constituents
of the 8th Congressional District, and to give them
my “<i>views and opinions upon the question of the
immediate admission of California, and other questions
now before Congress, arising out of the acquisition of
territory by the treaty with Mexico</i>.”</p>

<p>A request from so high a source has almost the force
of a command. Yet I dare not promise to comply. I
am liable at any moment to be recalled, and, instead
of speaking here, to vote there, upon the questions to
which you refer. I might be summoned to return on
the day appointed for us to meet. The only alternative,
therefore, which is left me, is to address you by
letter. This I will do, if I can find time. I shall thus
comply with your request, in substance, if not in form.</p>

<p>On many accounts, I have the extremest reluctance
to appear before the public on the present occasion.
My views, on some vital questions, differ most materially
from those of gentlemen for whom I have felt the
profoundest respect; and for some of whom I cherish
the strongest personal attachment. But I feel, on the
other hand, that my constituents, having intrusted to
me some of their most precious interests, are entitled<span class="pagenum" id="Page_237">[Pg 237]</span>
to know my “views and opinions” respecting the
hopes and the dangers that encompass them. I shall
not, therefore, take the responsibility of declining.</p>

<p>I will premise further, that my relations to political
parties, for many years past, have left me as free from
all partisan bias “as the lot of humanity will admit.”
For twelve years I held an office whose duties required
me to abstain from all active coöperation in political
conflicts; and that duty was so religiously fulfilled,
that, to my knowledge, I was never charged with its
violation. During the Presidential contest of 1848,
those obligations of neutrality still rested upon me.
For a year afterwards, I was not called upon to do any
official act displeasing to any party amongst us. This
interval I employed in forming the best opinion I could
of public men and measures, and their influence upon
the moral and industrial interests of the country. I
had long entertained most decided convictions in favor
of protecting American labor, in favor of cheap postage,
and of security to the lives and property of our fellow-citizens
engaged in commerce. But a new question
had arisen,—the great question of freedom or slavery
in our recently acquired territories,—and this question
I deemed, for the time being, to be, though not exclusive
of others, yet paramount to them. Or rather, I
saw that nothing could be so favorable to all the last-named
interests, as the proper adjustment of the first.
He who would provide for the welfare of mankind,
must first provide for their liberty.</p>

<p>Sympathizing, then, on different points with different
parties, but exclusively bound to none, I stood, in
reference to the great question of territorial freedom or
slavery, in the position of the <i>true</i> mother in the litigation
before Solomon, preferring that the object of
my love should be spared in the hands of any one,
rather than perish in my own.</p>

<p>Our present difficulties, which, as you well know,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_238">[Pg 238]</span>
have arrested the gaze of the nation, and almost suspended
the legislative functions of Congress, pertain to
the destiny of freedom or of slavery, to which our new
territories are to be devoted. After the acquisition of
Louisiana, and Florida, and Texas, for the aggrandizement
and security of the Slave-power; after the aboriginal
occupants of the soil of the Southern States have
been slaughtered, or driven from their homes, at an expense
of not less than a hundred millions of dollars,
and at the infinite expense of our national reputation
for justice and humanity; and after the area of the
slave states has been made almost double that of the
free states, while the population of the free is about
double that of the slave; the reasons seem so strong
that they can hardly be made stronger, why the career
of our government, as a slavery-extending power, should
be arrested. On the other hand, the oligarchy who
rule the south, seeing that, notwithstanding their rich
and almost illimitable domain, they are rapidly falling
behind the north in all the distinctive elements of civilization
and well being,—industry, temperance, education,
wealth,—not only defend the Upas that blasts
their soil, as though it were the tree of life, but seek to
transplant it to other lands. With but about three
slaves to a square mile,—three millions of slaves to
nearly a million of square miles,—they say they are
too crowded; that they feel a sense of suffocation, and
must have more room, when all their weakness and
pain proceed, not from the limited quantity, but from
the malignant quality of the atmosphere they breathe.
Hence the war with Mexico, commenced and prosecuted
to add slave territory and slave states to the
southern section. Hence the refusal to accept propositions
of peace, unless territory <i>south</i> of latitude
36° 30´, (the Missouri compromise line, so called,)
should be ceded to us. Hence, when the Mexican negotiators
proposed to insert a prohibition of slavery in<span class="pagenum" id="Page_239">[Pg 239]</span>
the treaty of cession, and declared that the inquisition
would not be more odious to the American people than
the reinstitution of slavery to them, our minister, Mr.
Trist, told them he would not consent to such a prohibition
though they would cover the soil a foot deep
with gold. And hence, also, the determination of a
portion of the southern members of Congress to stop
the whole machinery of the government, to sacrifice all
the great interests of the country, and assail even the
Union itself, unless slavery shall be permitted to cross
the Rio Grande and enter the vast regions of the west,
as it heretofore, in its aggressive march, crossed the
Mississippi and the Sabine.</p>

<p>Even in 1846, when the war against Mexico was
declared, all men of sagacity foresaw the present conflict.
Could that question have been decided on its
merits, or could the institutions to be planted upon the
territory we might acquire have been determined by
the unbiased suffrages of the American people, no war
would have been declared, and no territory acquired.
But the great political leaders of the south expected to
make up both for their numerical weakness and for the
injustice of their cause, by connecting the question of
slavery extension with that of future presidential elections
and with the strife of parties. They promised
themselves that they could draw over leading northern
men to their support, by offering them the Tantalus cup
of presidential honors; and then, by the force of party
cohesion and discipline, insure the support of the vast
descending scale of office expectants. Early in the
present session of Congress, it was distinctly declared
from a high southern source, that the south must do
most for those northern men who would do most for
them. A few words will make it apparent how faithfully
this plan has been adhered to, and how successful
it may become.</p>

<p>No northern Democrat, opposed to slavery extension,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_240">[Pg 240]</span>
could expect the support of the southern democracy.
Hence, General Cass stepped promptly forward, and declared,
in his Nicholson letter, that Congress had no
power to exclude slavery from the territories. This
has been technically called his “bid,” or his “first
bid.” It was deemed satisfactory by the south; for,
according to their philosophy, the relation of master
and slave is the natural or normal relation of mankind;
and therefore, where no prohibition of it exists, slavery
flows into free territory as water runs down hill. This
avowal of General Cass was rendered more signal and
valuable to the south, because, for the greater part of his
political life, he had taken oaths, held offices, and administered
laws, in undeniable contradiction to the
declaration then made. The ordinance of 1787 was
expressly recognized by the first Congress held under the
constitution, [see ch. 8.] It was modified in part, and
confirmed as to the rest; and in holding offices under
this, General Cass had laid the foundation of his honors
and his fortune. His declaration, therefore, against all
interdiction of slavery, made under circumstances so
extraordinary and in contradiction to the whole tenor
of his past life, was hailed with acclamation by the
south, and he was unanimously declared, at Baltimore,
to be the accepted candidate of the democracy, for the
office of President. The common notion is, that a man
shows his love for a cause by the amount of sacrifice
he will make for it; and as consistency, honor, and
truth, are the most precious elements in character,
he showed his devotion to the south by sacrificing
them all.</p>

<p>To the honor of the Whig party be it said, there
was not a northern man to be found, who, to gain the
support of the south, would espouse its pro-slavery
doctrines, or invent any new reading of the constitution
to give them a semblance of law. Hence, at the Philadelphia
Convention, no northern Whig received even<span class="pagenum" id="Page_241">[Pg 241]</span>
so much as a complimentary vote. The judicial eminence
of Judge McLean, the military eminence of General
Scott, were passed contemptuously by; and Mr.
Webster, acknowledged to be the greatest statesman of
the age, received but fourteen votes out of almost three
hundred; and twelve of these were from Massachusetts.
Mr. Webster had spoken more eloquent words
for liberty than any other living man, and this distinguished
neglect was doubtless intended to teach him
the lesson, that the path to presidential honors did not
lie through an advocacy of the rights of man. General
Taylor was nominated and chosen. He was understood
to take neutral ground. Discountenancing the
veto power, if the House of Representatives, who
are chosen directly from and by the people, and the
Senate, who are chosen by the states, will pass a territorial
bill, either with or without a prohibition of
slavery, he will approve it. This is the common opinion,
and I have no doubt of its correctness.</p>

<p>Under these circumstances, a most desperate effort
was made at the close of the last Congress to provide
a government for the territories with no prohibition of
slavery. Had General Cass been elected, no such effort
would have been necessary, for he was pledged to veto
a prohibition. General Taylor was supposed to be
pledged to an opposite course; and hence the struggle.
The facts must be so fresh in the recollection of all,
that they hardly need to be recounted. The House
performed its duty to the country and to freedom, by
sending territorial bills to the Senate containing the
prohibitory clause. The Senate, equalling the northern
by its southern votes, and far outnumbering the
Whigs by its Democrats, left those bills to sleep the
sleep of death upon its table. But during the closing
hours of the session, it foisted a provision for the government
of the territories into the general appropriation
bill; and held out the menace that this bill should<span class="pagenum" id="Page_242">[Pg 242]</span>
not pass at all, unless the territorial clause should pass
with it. The flagitiousness of this proceeding it is
difficult to comprehend and impossible to describe.
The appropriation bill is one on which the working,
and even the continuance of the government, depend.
Without it, the machinery of the state must cease to
move. Contracts by the government to pay money
must be violated. Officers cannot obtain their salaries.
Families must be left without subsistence. If long
continued, all judges would resign, and courts be broken
up; and when justice should cease to be administered,
violence, robbery, and every form of crime would run
riot through the land.</p>

<p>Besides, an appropriation bill and a bill for the government
of territories have no congruity with each
other. They are not relevant. Neither is germane to
the other. Every one knows it to be a common parliamentary
rule that when a proposition is submitted
which is susceptible of a division, any <i>one</i> member has
a right to demand it. All bills, too, for raising revenue,
must, by the constitution, originate in the House;
and the House has as much right to interfere to prevent
the Senate from ratifying a treaty, as the Senate has to
obstruct the passage of a revenue bill by adding to it
extraneous provisions. It was this effort on the part
of the Senate to incorporate into the appropriation bill
a provision most unrighteous in itself and most odious
to the free sentiments of the north, which led to the
protracted session on the night of the 3d of March,
1849. The course of the pro-slavery leaders, on that
occasion, resembled that of a madman who should
seize a torch and stand over the magazine of a ship,
and proclaim that he would send men and vessel to
destruction, unless they would steer for his port. A
portion of the House confederated with the majority of
the Senate in this unprincipled machination; but the
larger number stood undaunted, and after perils, such<span class="pagenum" id="Page_243">[Pg 243]</span>
as so precious an interest never before encountered,
the pro-slavery amendment was stricken out, and its
champions were foiled. Through that memorable
night the friends of freedom wrestled like Jacob with
the angel of God, and though the session did not close
until the sun of a Sabbath morning shone full into the
windows of the capitol, yet a holier work never was
done on that holy day.</p>

<p>It was with a joy such as no words can ever express,
that I saw the territories rescued from the clutch
of slavery by the expiration of the Thirtieth Congress.
I felt confident that when the Thirty-first Congress
should assemble, it would be under better auspices, and
with a stronger phalanx on the side of freedom. In
regard to California, those hopes have been fulfilled;
but I proceed to state how they have been nearly
extinguished in regard to the residue of the territory.</p>

<p>Our first disaster was the election of a most adroit,
talented, and zealous pro-slavery speaker. A better
organ for the accomplishment of their purposes the
friends of slavery could not have found; nor the
friends of freedom a more formidable opponent. Whilst
the pro-slavery champions of the south, almost without
distinction of party, exulted over this triumph, it has
been the occasion of most lamentable criminations and
recriminations at the north. Southern men abandon
all distinctions of Whig or Democrat for the cause of
slavery. Would to God we could do as much for the
cause of freedom.</p>

<p>The choice of a pro-slavery speaker was immediately
followed by the appointment of most ultra pro-slavery
committees. Some Free-Soil members, it is
true, were placed upon these committees; but in this,
the speaker only carried out more fully his own purposes
and those of his party, by putting, what they
considered as insane men, into close custody, instead of
letting them run at large. He showed, however, either<span class="pagenum" id="Page_244">[Pg 244]</span>
a want of courage in himself, or of confidence in his
chosen guards; for, on the District of Columbia committee
he detailed a file of five, on the judiciary committee
a file of four, and on the territorial committee a
file of six strong pro-slavery men, for the safe keeping
of one Free-Soiler.</p>

<p>Within an hour after the House was organized, Mr.
Root, of Ohio, submitted a resolution, instructing the
committee on territories to report territorial bills prohibiting
slavery. Many true friends to freedom believed
this movement to be ill timed and unfortunate;
and though the House then refused, by a handsome
vote, to lay the resolution on the table, yet when it
came up for consideration again, the first decision was
reversed by about the same majority. There is abundant
proof that the latter vote did not express the true
sentiment of the House. Not a few voted against the
resolution avowedly because of its paternity,—thus
spiting a noble son on account of its obnoxious father.
Others repented of their votes as soon as they came to
reflect that the record would go where their explanation
could not accompany it.</p>

<p>But unfortunately it was too late. There stands
the record, to survive through all time and to be read
of all men. The champions of slavery seized upon
this vote as a propitious omen. They derided and
scouted the proviso with a fierceness unknown before.
They shouted their threats of disunion with a more
defiant tone, should any attempt at what they called
its resurrection, be made. A speech was delivered by
Mr. Clingman, of North Carolina, in which a massacre
of a majority of the House was distinctly shadowed
forth, so that not “a quorum should be left to do business.”
The effect of that vote was almost as bad as
though it meant what it said.</p>

<p>At a later day, when a bill for the admission of California
was presented, the tactics of delay were resorted<span class="pagenum" id="Page_245">[Pg 245]</span>
to, and midnight found us calling the yeas and nays,
for more than the thirtieth time, on questions whose
frivolousness and vexatiousness cannot be indicated by
numbers.</p>

<p>The proceedings in the Senate, however, are those
which now threaten the most disastrous consequences.
Early in the session, in order to bring his northern
friends up to the doctrine that it is unconstitutional to
legislate against slavery in the territories, General Cass
made a speech, in which he denies that Congress has
<i>any</i> power, under <i>any</i> circumstances, to pass <i>any</i> law
respecting their inhabitants. According to that speech,
the United States stands in the relation of a foreign
government to the people of its own territories; and
if they set up a king or establish a religion, we cannot
help it; for we have no more power or right to control
them than we have the subjects of Great Britain or
the citizens of France. It has been said that the doctrine
of General Cass and that of General Taylor, on
this subject, are identical; but there is this all-important
difference between them:—General Taylor
maintains the right of Congress to legislate for the territories,
and will doubtless approve any bill for the
prohibition of slavery in them; but General Cass, denying
this right in Congress, would, if President, veto
such a bill. He, therefore, would leave the territories
open to be invaded and possessed by slavery; and in
southern law and practice possession is more than
nine points.</p>

<p>Next came Mr. Clay’s compromise resolutions, so
called. By these, California was to be admitted as a
state; the territories organized without any restriction
upon slavery; the south-western boundary of Texas to
be extended to the Rio Grande; a part of her ten or
twelve million debt to be paid by the United States,
on condition of her abandoning her claim to a part of
New Mexico lying east of the Rio Grande; the abolition<span class="pagenum" id="Page_246">[Pg 246]</span>
of the slave trade in the District of Columbia, and
the inviolability of slavery in the District daring the
good pleasure of Maryland and of the inhabitants of
the District; more effectual provision for the restitution
of fugitive slaves, and free traffic in slaves forever between
the states, unless forbidden by themselves.</p>

<p>A compromise is a settlement of difficulties by mutual
concessions. Let us examine the mutuality of the
concessions which Mr. Clay’s resolutions propose.</p>

<p>In the first place, California is to be permitted to
remain free if the territories of New Mexico and Utah may
be opened to slavery. But California is free already;
free by her own act; free without any concession of
theirs, and without any grace but the grace of God.
It is mainly occupied by a northern population, who
do their own work with their own hands, or their own
brains. Fifty hardy gold diggers from the north will
never stand all day knee deep in water, shovel earth,
rock washers, &amp;c., under a broiling sun, and see a man
with his fifty slaves standing under the shade of a tree,
or having an umbrella held over his head, with whip
in hand, and without wetting his dainty glove, or soiling
his japanned boot, pocket as much at night as the
whole of them together. Or, rather, they will never
suffer institutions to exist which tolerate such unrighteousness.
California, therefore, is free; as free as
Massachusetts; and Mr. Clay might as well have said
in terms, that whereas Massachusetts is free, therefore
New Mexico and Utah shall be slave, or run the hazard
of being so.</p>

<p>The next point of Mr. Clay’s compromise is, that
Texas shall extend her south-western boundary from
or near the Nueces to the Rio Grande, and shall receive,
probably, some six or eight millions of dollars for
withdrawing her claim to that part of New Mexico
which lies east of the last-named river. Now, Texas
has no rightful or plausible claim to a foot of all this<span class="pagenum" id="Page_247">[Pg 247]</span>
territory. But suppose it to be a subject of doubt, and
therefore of compromise. The mutuality, then, consists
in dividing the whole territory claimed by Texas,
and then giving her a valid title to one portion of it,
and paying her for all the rest. Texas, or,—what in this
connection is the same thing,—slavery surrenders absolutely
nothing, gets a good title to some seventy
thousand square miles of territory, and pay for as
much more!</p>

<p>But what renders it almost incredible that any man
could soberly submit such a proposition and dare to
call it a compromise, is this: All that part of New
Mexico which Texas claims, and which lies between
the parallels of 36° 30´ and 42°, is, by the resolutions of
annexation, to be forever free. I shall consider the
constitutionality of these resolutions by and by; I now
treat them as valid. Now the compromise proposes to
buy this territory, so secured to freedom, and annex it
to New Mexico, which is to be left open to slavery.
We are to peril all the broad region between 36° 30´
and 42°, and pay Texas some six or eight millions of
dollars for the privilege of doing so! Mr. Clay is not
less eminent for his statesmanship than for his waggery.
Were he to succeed in playing off this practical joke upon
the north, and were it not for the horrible consequences
which it would involve, a roar of laughter, like a <i>feu
de joie</i>, would run down the course of the ages. As
it is, the laughter will be “elsewhere.”</p>

<p>The next point pertains to the abolition of the slave
trade, and the perpetuity of slavery, in the District of
Columbia. This District has an area of about fifty
square miles; and Mr. Clay proposes, in consideration
of transferring its slave marts to Alexandria, on the
Virginia side, or to some convenient place in Montgomery
or Prince George’s county, on the Maryland
side, to divest Congress forever of its right of “exclusive
legislation” over it. Should this plan prevail, the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_248">[Pg 248]</span>
perpetuity of slavery in the District will be defended
by more unassailable and impregnable barriers than
any other institution in Christendom. The President
has a veto upon Congress; but two thirds of both
Houses may still pass any law, notwithstanding his
dissent. Mr. Clay proposes to give, both to Maryland
and to the citizens of the District, a veto on this subject;—an
absolute veto, not a qualified one, like that
of the President of the United States, but one that
will control, not majorities merely, but an absolute
unanimity in both branches of Congress. By his plan,
therefore, three separate, independent powers are to
have a veto upon the abolition of slavery in the District
of Columbia. And not only so, but while it will
require their <i>joint</i> or <i>concurrent</i> action to abolish the
institution, any one of them can preserve it. The laws
of the Medes and Persians had no such guaranties for
perpetuity as this.</p>

<p>Mr. Clay’s last point is really too facetious. So
solemn a subject does not permit such long-continued
levity, however it may be masked by sobriety of countenance.
It is, that Congress shall make more effectual
provision for the capture and delivery of fugitive
slaves; and, as an equivalent for this, it shall bind
itself never to interfere with the inter-state traffic in
slaves. We are to catch the slaves of the South, and, as
though this were a grateful privilege to us, we are to
allow them free commerce in slaves, coastwise or inland.
By this means, slaves can be transported to the mouth
of the Rio Grande, and some hundreds of miles up that
river, towards New Mexico, instead of being driven in
coffles across the country. The compromise is, that
for every slave we catch, we are to facilitate the passage
of a hundred into New Mexico.</p>

<p>Such is the mutuality of Mr. Clay’s compromises.
They are such compromises as the wolf offers to the
lamb, or the vulture to the dove. They make the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_249">[Pg 249]</span>
rightful admission of California into the Union, with
her free constitution, contingent upon opening the new
territories to slavery; they ratify one part of the predatory
claim of Texas, and propose to give her millions
for the other part; they give an unconditional
veto to the state of Maryland and to the citizens of
the District of Columbia, over a unanimous vote of
both Houses of Congress, even when approved by the
President; in connection with Mr. Butler’s bill and
Mr. Mason’s amendments, they expose our white citizens
to grievous penalties and imprisonments for not
doing what the Supreme Court of the United States
has decided we are not bound to do, in relation to
fugitive slaves, and they offer our colored citizens to
be kidnapped and spirited away into bondage; and
they foreclose, in favor of the south, the disputed
question of the inter-state commerce in slaves. In
one particular only do they appear to concede any
thing to northern rights, or northern convictions, or
northern feelings. They propose to transfer the District
of Columbia slave trade across an ideal line into
Virginia or into Maryland, so that the slave planter or
slave trader, when he comes to our American Congo
to replenish his stock of human cattle, shall be obliged
to go a mile or two, to the slave marts, instead of
walking down Pennsylvania Avenue. I deem this to
be no concession. If it is honorable to produce corn
and cotton, it is honorable to buy and sell them,—and
if it is honorable to hold beings created in God’s
image in slavery, it is honorable to stand between the
producer and consumer, and to make merchandise of
the bodies and the souls of men. Let this Light of the
Age be set upon a hill, that all nations may behold it.</p>

<p>I will refer to Mr. Bell’s resolutions no further than
to say, that they propose the formation of three slave
states out of what is now claimed by Texas, one of
which is to be admitted into the Union forthwith as
an offset to California.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_250">[Pg 250]</span></p>

<p>Mr. Buchanan has not regarded the movements of
his rival, General Cass, with indifference. He has
spent a considerable portion of the winter in Washington,
and it is understood that he holds out the Missouri
compromise line, from the western boundary of
Missouri to the Pacific Ocean, as his lure to the south,
for their favorable regards in the ensuing presidential
contest.</p>

<p>In a chronological order, I must now consider some
vitally important views, which have been submitted
by some members in the House, and by Mr. Webster
and others in the Senate. In mentioning the name
of this great statesman, and in avowing that I am one
among the many whom his recently expressed opinions
have failed to convince, it is due to myself, however
indifferent it may be to him or to his friends, that
I should express my admiration of his powers, my
gratitude for his past services, and the diffidence with
which I dissented, at first, from his views. But I
have pondered upon them long, and the longer I have
pondered the more questionable they appear. I shall
therefore venture upon the perilous task of inquiring
into their correctness; and while I do it with the deference
and respect which belong to his character, I
shall do it also with that fidelity to conscience and to
judgment that belong to mine. He is great, but truth
is greater than us all.</p>

<p>I shall confine myself mainly, and perhaps wholly,
to Mr. Webster’s views, because he has argued the
cause of the south with vastly more ability than it has
been argued by any one among themselves. If his
conclusions, then, be not tenable, their case is lost.<a id="FNanchor_9" href="#Footnote_9" class="fnanchor">[9]</a></p>

<p>Mr. Webster casts away the “Proviso” altogether.<span class="pagenum" id="Page_251">[Pg 251]</span>
He says, “<i>If a resolution or a law were now before
us to provide a territorial government for New Mexico,
I would not vote to put any prohibition into it whatever</i>.”
(p. 44.) The reason given is, that slavery is
already excluded from “California and New Mexico”
“by the law of nature, of physical geography, the law
of the formation of the earth.” (p. 42.) “California
and New Mexico are Asiatic in their formation and
scenery. They are composed of vast ridges of mountains
of enormous height, with broken ridges and
deep valleys.” (p. 43.)</p>

<p>Now, this is drawing moral conclusions from physical
premises. It is arguing from physics to metaphysics.
It is determining the law of the spirit by
geographical phenomena. It is undertaking to settle
by mountains and rivers, and not by the Ten Commandments,
a great question of human duty. It
abandons the second commandment of Christ and all
bills of rights enacted in conformity thereto, and
leaves our obligations to our “neighbor” to be determined
by the accidents of earth and water and air.
To ascertain whether a people will obey the Divine
command, and do to others as they would be done by,
it looks at the thermometer. What a problem would
this be: “Required the height above the level of the
sea at which the oppressor ‘will undo the heavy burdens
and let the oppressed go free, and break every
yoke,’—to be determined barometrically.” Alas!
this cannot be done. Slavery depends, not upon climate,
but upon conscience. Wherever the wicked
passions of the human heart can go, there slavery can
go. Slavery is an effect. Avarice, sloth, pride, and
the love of domination, are its cause. In ascending
mountain sides, at what altitude do men leave these
passions behind them? Different vegetable growths
are to be found at different heights, depending also
upon the zone. This I can understand. There is the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_252">[Pg 252]</span>
altitude of the palm, the altitude of the oak, the altitude
of the pine, and, far above them all, the line of
perpetual snow. But, in regard to innocence and
guilt, where is the <i>white line</i>? How high up can a
slaveholder go and not lose his free agency? At what
elevation will the whip fall from the hand of the master,
and the fetter from the limbs of the slave? There
is no such point. Freedom and slavery on the one
hand, and climate and geology on the other, are incommensurable
quantities. We might as well attempt
to determine a question in theology by the cube root,
or a question in ethics by the black art. Slavery,
being a crime founded upon human passions, can go
wherever those passions are unrestrained. It has existed
in Asia from the earliest ages, notwithstanding
its “formation and scenery.” It labors and groans on
the flanks of the Ural mountains now. There are
to-day forty-eight millions of slaves in Russia, not
one rood of which comes down so low as the northern
boundary of California and New Mexico.</p>

<p>Had Mr. Webster’s philosophy been correct, then
California was at superfluous pains when she incorporated
the ordinance of 1787 into her constitution.
Instead of saying that “slavery and involuntary servitude,
(except for crime,) shall be forever prohibited,”
she should have said, “Whereas, by a law of nature,
of physical geography, the law of the formation of the
earth,” “slavery cannot exist in California,” therefore
we will not “reaffirm an ordinance of nature, nor reenact
the will of God.”</p>

<p>Should it be said that slavery will not go into the
new territories, because it is unprofitable; I ask, Where
is it profitable? Where is ignorance so profitable as
knowledge? Where is ungodliness gain, even for the
things of this life? How little is the hand worth at
one end of an arm, if there is not a brain at the other!
Do not Maryland, Virginia, North Carolina, and other<span class="pagenum" id="Page_253">[Pg 253]</span>
states, furnish witnesses by thousands and tens of
thousands that slavery impoverishes? Yet with what
enthusiasm they cherish it! Generally, ignorance is a
necessary concomitant of slavery. Of white persons,
over twenty years of age, unable to read and write,
there were, according to the last census, 58,787 in
Virginia, 56,609 in North Carolina, 58,513 in Tennessee,
and so forth. I have a letter before me, received
this morning, dated in Indiana, in which the
writer says, he removed from North Carolina in 1802,
when he was fourteen years old, and at that time he
had never seen a newspaper in his life. Can there be
genius, the inventive talent, or profitable labor, where
ignorance is so dense? Can the oppression that tramples
out voluntary industry, enterprise, intelligence, and
the desire of independence, conduce to riches? Yet this
is done wherever slavery exists, and is part and parcel
of its working. Is any other form of robbery profitable?
Yet individuals and communities have practised it and
lived by it, and we may as well rely upon a “law of
physical geography” to arrest the one as the other.
It is not poetry, but literal truth, that the breath of the
slave blasts vegetation, his tears poison the earth, and
his groans strike it with sterility. It would be easy
to show why the master does not abandon slavery,
even amid the desolation with which it has surrounded
him. There is a combination of poverty and pride,
which slavery produces, <i>on the doctrine of natural
appetence</i>, and which, therefore, it exactly fits. The
helplessness of the master in regard to all personal
wants seems to necessitate the slavery that has begotten
it. All moral and religious principles are lowered
till they conform to the daily practice. Custom blinds
conscience, until, without any attempt to emancipate
or ameliorate their victims, men can preach and pray
and hold slaves, as Hamlet’s grave digger jests and
sings while he turns up skulls.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_254">[Pg 254]</span></p>

<p>But slavery cannot go into California or New Mexico,
because their staple productions are not “tobacco,
corn, cotton, or rice.” (p. 44.) These are agricultural
products. But is slave labor confined to agriculture?
Suppose that predial slavery will not become common
in the new territories. Cannot menial? If
slaves cannot do field work, cannot they do house
work? There is an opening for a hundred thousand
slaves to-day in the new territories, for purposes of
domestic labor. And beyond this, let me ask, who
possesses any such geologic vision that, at a distance
of a thousand miles, he can penetrate the valleys and
gorges of New Mexico, and say that gold will not yet
be found there as it is in California,—not in sand and
gravel only, but in forty-eight-pounders and fifty-sixes?
This is the very kind of labor on which slaves, in all
time, have been so extensively employed,—the very
labor on which a million of slaves in Hispaniola lost
their lives, within a few years after its discovery by
Columbus. Gold deposits are now worked within
twenty-five miles of Santa Fe. The last account
which I have seen, of a company of emigrants passing
from Santa Fe to California by the River Gila, announces
rich discoveries of gold upon that river. A
fellow-citizen of mine has just returned home, who
says he saw a slave sold at the mines in California, in
September last. As yet, the distant regions of the
Gila and the Colorado cannot be worked, because of
the Apaches, the Utahs, and other tribes of Indians.
But admit slavery there, and the power of the government
will be invoked to exterminate these Indians, as
it was before to exterminate the Cherokees and Seminoles,—not
to drive them beyond the Mississippi, but
beyond the Styx. A few days since a letter was published
in the papers, dated on board a steamer descending
the Mississippi, which stated that a considerable
number of slaves were on board, bound for California,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_255">[Pg 255]</span>
under an agreement with their masters that they should
be free after serving two years at the mines. We
know, too, that the reason assigned for incorporating a
provision in the constitution of California, authorizing
its legislature to pass laws for the exclusion of free
blacks from the state, was, that slaves would be brought
there under this very form of agreement, and by and
by the country would be overspread by people of
color who had bought their freedom. The sagacious
men who framed the California constitution came from
all parts of the territory, and, being collected on the
spot, having surveyed all its mountains, having breathed
its air at all temperatures, and turned up its golden
soil,—these men had never discovered any “law
of physical geography” which the fell spirit of slavery
could not transgress. Slaves were carried into Oregon,
ten degrees of latitude higher up. Its colonists reënacted
the ordinance of 1787 before Congress gave them
a territorial government. In the territorial government
that was given them, the prohibition was inserted;
and President Polk signed the bill, with an express
protest, that he ratified this exclusion of slavery
only because the country lay north of the Missouri
compromise line; but declared that, had it embraced the
very region in question, he would have vetoed the bill.</p>

<p>General Cass never took the ground that slavery
<i>could not</i> exist in the new territories; and no inconsiderable
part of the opposition made to him in Massachusetts
and in other free states, was placed expressly upon
the ground that he would not prohibit it. Mr. Webster,
in his Marshfield speech, September 1, 1848, opposed
the election of General Cass, because, through
his recreancy to northern principles, slavery would
invade the territories. This was expressed with his
usual clearness and force, as follows:—</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>“He, [General <span class="smcap">Cass</span>,] will surely have the Senate; and with
the patronage of the government, with every interest that he,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_256">[Pg 256]</span>
as a northern man, can bring to bear, coöperating with every
interest that the south can bring to bear, we cry safety before
we are out of the woods, <i>if we feel that there is no danger as
to these new territories</i>.”</p>
</div>

<p>Yet Mr. Webster now says, that to support the
“Proviso,” would “do disgrace to his own understanding.”
(p. 46.)</p>

<p>During the same campaign, also, the Hon. Rufus
Choate, one of the most eloquent men in New England,
and known to be the personal friend of Mr. Webster,
delivered a speech at Salem, in which the following
passage occurs:—</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>“It is the passage of a law to say that California and New
Mexico shall remain forever free. That is, fellow-citizens,
undoubtedly an object of great and transcendent importance;
for there is none who will deny that we should go up to the
very limits of the constitution itself, and with the wisdom of
the wisest, and zeal of the most zealous, should unite to accomplish
this great object, and to defeat the always detested,
and forever to be detested object of the dark ambition of
that candidate of the Baltimore convention, (General <span class="smcap">Cass</span>,)
who has ventured to pledge himself in advance that he will
veto the future law of freedom; and may God avert the madness
of all those who hate slavery and love freedom, that
would unite in putting him in the place where his thrice
accursed pledge may be redeemed!... Is there a
Whig upon this floor who doubts that the strength of the Whig
party next March will insure freedom to California and New
Mexico, if by the constitution they are entitled to freedom at
all? Is there a member of Congress that would not vote for
freedom? You know there is not one. Did not every Whig
member of Congress from the free states vote at the last session
for freedom? You know that every man of them returned
home covered with the thanks of his constituents for
that vote. Is there a single Whig constituency, in any free
state in this country, that would return any man that would
not vote for freedom? <i>Do you believe that Daniel Webster
himself could be returned if there was the least doubt upon
the question?</i>”</p>
</div>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_257">[Pg 257]</span></p>

<p>Mr. Choate then adds: “Upon this question alone,
we always differ from those Whigs of the south; and
on that one, we <i>propose simply to vote them down</i>.”
Mr. Webster now says he will not join in voting them
down.</p>

<p>Under such circumstances, is it frivolous or captious
to ask for something more than a dogmatic assertion
that slavery cannot impregnate these new regions, and
cause them to breed monsters forever? On a subject
of such infinite importance I cannot be satisfied with a
dictum; I want a demonstration. I cannot accept the
prophecy without inquiring what spirit inspired the
prophet. As a revelation from Heaven, it would be most
delightful; but, as it conflicts with all human experience,
it requires at least one undoubted miracle to attest
the divinity of its origin.</p>

<p>According to the last census, there were more than
eight thousand persons of African blood in Massachusetts.
Abolish the moral and religious convictions of
our people, let slavery appear to be in their sight not
only lawful and creditable, but desirable as a badge of
aristocratic distinction, and as a “political, social, moral,
and religious blessing,” and what obstacle would prevent
these eight thousand persons from being turned
into slaves, on any day, by the easy, cheap, and shorthand
kidnapping of a legislative act? Africans can
exist here, for the best of all reasons,—they do exist
here. A state of slavery would not stop their respiration,
nor cause them to vanish “into thin air.” Think,
for a moment, of the complaints we constantly hear in
certain circles, of the difficulty and vexatiousness of commanding
domestic service. If no moral or religious
objection existed against holding slaves, would not
many of those respectable and opulent gentlemen who
signed the letter of thanks to Mr. Webster, and hundreds
of others indeed, instead of applying to intelligence
offices, or visiting emigrant ships for “domestics,”<span class="pagenum" id="Page_258">[Pg 258]</span>
as we call them, go at once to the auction room
and buy a man or a woman with as little hesitancy or
compunction as they now send to Brighton for beeves,
or go to Tattersall’s for a horse? If the cold of the
higher latitudes checks the flow of African blood, or
benumbs African limbs, the slaveholder knows very
well that a trifling extra expense for whips will make
up for the difference.</p>

<p>But suppose a doubt could be reasonably entertained
about the invasion of the new territories by slavery.
Even suppose the chances to preponderate against it.
What then? Are we to submit a question of human
liberty over vast regions and for an indefinite extent of
time, to the determination of chance? With all my
faculties I say, <i>No!</i> Let me ask any man, let me respectfully
ask Mr. Webster himself, if it were his own
father and mother, and brothers and sisters, and sons
and daughters, who were in peril of such a fate,
whether he would abandon them to chance,—even to
a favorable chance. Would he suffer their fate to be
determined by dice or divination, when positive prohibition
was in his power? And by what rule of
Christian morality, or even of enlightened heathen
morality, can we deal differently with the kindred of
others from what we would with our own? He is not
a Christian whose humanity is bounded by the legal
degrees of blood, or by general types of feature.</p>

<p>But Mr. Webster would not “taunt” the south.
Neither would I. I would not taunt any honorable man,
much less a criminal. Still, when the most precious interests
of humanity are in peril, I would not be timid. I
would not stop too long to cull lovers’ phrases. Standing
under the eye of God, in the forum of the world and
before the august tribunal of posterity, when the litigants
are freedom and tyranny, and human happiness
and human misery the prize they contest, it should
happen to the sworn advocate of liberty, as Quintilian<span class="pagenum" id="Page_259">[Pg 259]</span>
says it did to Demosthenes, “not to speak and to
plead, but to thunder and to lighten.” Mr. Webster
would not taunt the south; and yet I say the south
were never so insulted before as he has insulted them.
Common scoffs, jeers, vilifications, are flattery and
sycophancy compared with the indignities he heaped
upon them. Look at the facts. The south waged
war with Mexico from one, and only one, motive; for
one, and only one, object,—the extension of slavery.
They refused peace unless it surrendered territory.
That territory must be south of the abhorred line of
36° 30´. The same President who abandoned the
broad belt of country on our northern frontier, from
49° to 54° 40´, to which we had, in his own words,
“an unquestionable title,” would allow no prohibition
of slavery to be imposed upon the territory which
Mexico ceded, though she would bury it a foot deep
in gold. The Proviso had been resisted in all forms,
from the beginning. Southern Whigs voted against
the ratification of the treaty, foreseeing the struggle
that was to follow. Desperate efforts had been made,
at the close of the last session of Congress, to smuggle
in an unrestricted territorial government, against all
parliamentary rule and all constitutional implication.
The whole south, as one man, claimed it as a “describable,
weighable, estimable, tangible,” and most
valuable “right” to carry slaves there. Calhoun, Berrien,
Badger, Mason, Davis,—the whole southern
phalanx, Whig and Democrat, pleaded for it, argued for
it, and most of them declared themselves ready to fight
for it; and yet Mr. Webster rises in his place, and tells
them they are all moonstruck, hallucinated, fatuous;
because “an ordinance of nature and the will of God”
had settled this question against them from the beginning
of the world. Mr. Calhoun said, immediately
after this speech, “Give us free scope and time enough,
and we will take care of the rest.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_260">[Pg 260]</span></p>

<p><span class="smcap">Mr. Mason</span> said,—</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>“We have heard here from various quarters, and from
high quarters, and repeated on all hands,—repeated here
again to-day by the honorable senator from Illinois, [Mr.
<span class="smcap">Shields</span>,] that there is a law of nature which excludes the
southern people from every portion of the state of California.
I know of no such law of nature,—none whatever; but I
do know the contrary, that if California had been organized
with a territorial form of government only, and for which, at
the last two sessions of Congress, she has obtained the entire
southern vote, the people of the Southern States would have
gone there freely, and have taken their slaves there in great
numbers. They would have done so, because the value of the
labor of that class would have been augmented to them many
hundred fold. Why, in the debates which took place in the
convention in California which formed the constitution, and
which any senator can now read for himself, after the provision
excluding slavery was agreed upon, it was proposed to
prohibit the African race altogether, free as well as bond. A
debate arose upon it, and the ground was distinctly taken, as
shown in those debates, that if the entire African race was
not excluded, their labor would be found so valuable that the
owners of slaves would bring them there, even though slavery
were prohibited, under a contract to manumit them in two or
three years. And it required very little reasoning, on the
part of those opposed to this class of population, to show that
the productiveness of their labor would be such as to cause
that result. An estimate was gone into with reference to the
value of the labor of this class of people, showing that it
would be increased to such an extent in the mines of California,
that they could not be kept out. It was agreed that
the labor of a slave in any one of the states from which they
would be taken, was not worth more than one hundred or one
hundred and fifty dollars a year, and that in California it
would be worth from four to six thousand dollars. They
would work themselves free in one or two years, and thus the
country would be filled by a class of free blacks, and their
former owners have an excellent bargain in taking them
there.”</p>
</div>

<p>Yet Mr. Webster stands up before all this array, and<span class="pagenum" id="Page_261">[Pg 261]</span>
says, “Gentlemen, you are beside yourselves. You
have eaten ‘of the insane root.’ You would look
more in character should you put on the ‘cap and
bells.’ In sober sense, in seeing his object clearly and
in pursuing it directly, Don Quixote was Doctor
Franklin, compared with <i>you</i>. The dog in the fable,
who dropped his meat to snap at his shadow, is no allegory
in your case. I see two classes around me,—wise
men and fools; <i>you</i> do not belong to the former.
The chancellor, who keeps the king’s idiots, should
have custody of you.” Such is a faithful abstract of
what Mr. Webster said to southern senators, and,
through them, to all the south.</p>

<p>Here certainly was a reflection upon the understanding
and intelligence of the south, such as never was
cast upon them before. But the balm went with the
sting. They bore the affront to their judgments, because
it was so grateful to their politics and pockets.
I think it no injustice to those senators to say, that they
would have nearly torn Mr. Webster in pieces for such
a collective insult, had it not promised to add, what
Mr. Mason called “many hundred fold,” to their individual
property, and to secure and perpetuate their political ascendency.</p>

<p>To help our conceptions in regard to Mr. Webster’s
course on this subject, let us imagine a parallel case,—or,
rather, an approximate one, for there can be no parallel.
Suppose a contest between the north and the
south, on the subject of the tariff, to have been raging
for years. The sober blood of the north is heated to
the fever point. The newspapers treat of nothing else.
Public meetings and private conversations discuss no
other theme. Hundreds of delegates wait upon Congress
to add, if it be but a feather’s weight, to the
scale which holds their interests. Petitions flow in,
in thousands and tens of thousands. It is announced
that Mr. Calhoun will pour out his great mind on the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_262">[Pg 262]</span>
subject. Expectation is on tiptoe. All eyes, from all
sides of the country, are turned towards Washington,
as the Moslem’s to Mecca. The senate chamber is
packed, and the illustrious senator rises. After an historic
sketch of existing difficulties, after reading from
the speeches which he made in 1832 and in 1846, he
proceeds to say that he withdraws all opposition to a
tariff,—to any tariff! He will not offend the delicate
nerves of northern manufacturers by further hostility.
Were a bill then before him, he would not oppose it.
“Take the schedules,” says he, scornfully, to northern
senators, “and fill up the blanks from A to Z with
what per centages you please. For <i>ad valorem</i> rates,
put in minimums and maximums at your pleasure. I
will ‘taunt’ you no longer. I am for peace and the
glorious Union. I have discovered an irrepealable and
irreversible law of nature, which overrules all the devices
of men. You cannot make one yard of woollens
or cottons in New England. There, water has no
gravity, steam has no force, and wheels will not revolve.
In Vermont and New York, wool will not
grow on sheep’s backs. I have penetrated the geology
of Pennsylvania, and through all its stratifications
there is not a thimble full of coal, nor an ounce of iron
ore; and, if there were, combustion would not help to
forge it; for oxygen and carbon are divorced. As
Massachusetts contributed one third of the men and
one third of the money to carry on the revolutionary
war, I am willing to compensate her for her lost blood
and treasure to the amount of hundreds of millions
of dollars, with which she may fertilize the barrenness
of her genius, and indulge her insane love for churches
and schools.” Had the great southern senator spoken
thus, I think that even idolatrous, man-worshipping
South Carolina,—a state which Mr. Calhoun has
ruled and moved for the last twenty-five years, as a
puppet showman plays Punch and Judy,—would<span class="pagenum" id="Page_263">[Pg 263]</span>
have sent forth, through all her organs, a voice of unanimous
dissent.</p>

<p>As much as freedom is higher than tariff, so much
stronger than their dissent should be ours.</p>

<p>Mr. Webster’s averment that he would not “reäffirm
an ordinance of nature, nor reënact the will of God,”
(p. 44,) has been commented on more pungently than I
am able or willing to do. It has been well said that all
law and all volition must be in harmony with the will
of the Good Spirit, or with that of the evil one; and
if we will not reënact the will of the former, then,
either all legislation ceases, or we must register the decrees
of the latter. But one important and pertinent
consideration belongs to this subject, which I have nowhere
seen developed. It is this: Endless doubts and
contradictions exist among men, as to what is the will
of God; and on no subject is there a wider diversity
of opinion than on this very subject of slavery.
Whose law was reënacted by the ordinance of 1787?
whose, when the African slave trade was prohibited?
whose, when it was declared piracy? True, it is useless
to put upon our statute books an astronomical law,
regulating sunrise, or high tides; but that is physical
and beyond the jurisdiction of man, while slavery belongs
to morals, and is within the jurisdiction of man.
Cease to transcribe upon the statute book what our
wisest and best men believe to be the will of God in
regard to our worldly affairs, and the passions which
we think appropriate to devils will soon take possession
of society. In regard to slavery, piracy, and so forth,
there are multitudes of men whose fear of the penal
sanctions of another life is very much aided by a little
salutary fine and imprisonment in this. Look at that
noble array of principles which is contained in the
Declaration of Rights in the constitution of Massachusetts.
Is it not a most grand and beautiful exposition
of “the will of God,”—a transcript, as it were, from<span class="pagenum" id="Page_264">[Pg 264]</span>
the Book of Life? So of the amendments to the
constitution of the United States. Yet our fathers
thought it no tampering with holy things to enact
them; and, in times of struggle and peril, they have
been to many a tempted man as an anchor to the soul,
sure and steadfast.</p>

<p>I approach Mr. Webster’s treatment of the Texas
question with no ordinary anxiety. Having been accustomed
from my very boyhood to regard him as the
almost infallible expounder of constitutional law, it is
impossible to describe the struggle, the revulsion of
mind, with which I have passed from an instructed
and joyous acquiescence in his former opinions to unhesitating
dissent from his present ones.</p>

<p>I must premise that I cannot see any necessary or
beneficial connection between the subject of new
Texan states and the admission of California and the
government of the territories. The former refers to
some indefinite future, when, from its fruitful womb
of slavery, Texas shall seek to cast forth an untimely
birth. In this excited state of the country, at this
critical juncture of our affairs, when there is sober talk
of massacring a majority of the House of Representatives
on their own floor, and a senator, instead of
merely threatening to hang a brother senator on the
highest tree, provided he could catch him in his own
state, now draws a revolver of six barrels on another
brother senator, on the floor of the Senate, in mid-session;
at such a time, I say, when, however few Abels
there may be at work in the political field, there are
Cains more than enough, would it not have been well
to have acted upon the precept, “Sufficient unto the
day is the evil thereof”?</p>

<p>As the basis of his argument, Mr. Webster quotes
the following resolution for the admission of Texas,
passed March 1, 1845:—</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_265">[Pg 265]</span></p><div class="blockquot">

<p>“New states of convenient size, not exceeding four in
number, in addition to said State of Texas, and having sufficient
population, may hereafter, by the consent of the said
state, be formed out of the territory thereof, which shall be
entitled to admission under the provisions of the federal constitution.
And such states as may be formed out of that portion
of said territory lying south of 36° 30´ north latitude,
commonly known as the Missouri compromise line, shall be
admitted into the Union with or without slavery, as the people
of each state asking admission may desire; and in such state
or states as shall be formed out of said territory north of said
Missouri compromise line, slavery or involuntary servitude,
(except for crime,) shall be prohibited.”</p>
</div>

<p>Note here, first, that only “<i>four</i>” states are to be
admitted in “addition to said state of Texas;” and
second, that “such state or <i>states</i>,” (in the plural,) as
shall be formed from territory north of 36° 30´, <i>shall
be free</i>. If <i>two</i>, or only <i>one</i> free state is to exist on
the <i>north</i> side of the line, then how many will be left
for the <i>south</i> side? I should expose myself to ridicule
were I to set it down arithmetically, <i>four</i> minus <i>one</i>,
equal to <i>three</i>. Yet Mr. Webster says, “The guaranty
is, that new states shall be made out of it, [the Texan
territory,] and that such states as are formed out of
that portion of Texas lying south of 36° 30´, may
come in as slave states, to <i>the number of</i> <span class="allsmcap">FOUR</span>, in addition
to the state then in existence, and admitted at
that time by these resolutions.” (p. 29.)</p>

<p>Here Mr. Webster gives outright to the south and to
slavery, one more state than was contracted for,—assuming
the contract to be valid. He makes a donation,
a gratuity, of an entire slave state, larger than many
a European principality. He transfers a whole state,
with all its beating hearts, present and future; with all
its infinite susceptibilities of weal and woe, from the
side of freedom to that of slavery, in the ledger book
of humanity. What a bridal gift for the harlot of
bondage!</p>

<p>Was not the bargain hard enough, according to its<span class="pagenum" id="Page_266">[Pg 266]</span>
terms? Must we fulfil it, and go beyond it? Is a
slave state, which dooms our brethren of the human
race, perhaps interminably, to the vassal’s fate, so insignificant
a trifle, that it may be flung in, as small change
on the settlement of an account? Has the south been
so generous a copartner as to deserve this distinguished
token of our gratitude?</p>

<p>Why, by parity of reasoning, could he not have
claimed all the four states, “in addition to said state
of Texas,” as free states? The resolutions divide the
territory into two parts, one north and one south of
the line of 36° 30´. Could not Mr. Webster have
claimed the four states for freedom, with as sound logic
and with far better humanity than he surrendered them
all to slavery? When Texas and the south have got
their slave states “<i>to the number of four</i>” into the
Union, whence are we to obtain our one or more free
states? The contract will have been executed, and
the consent of Texas for another state will be withheld.</p>

<p>Notwithstanding all this, Mr. Webster affirms the
right of slavery to four more states, in the following
words: “I know no form of legislation which can
strengthen this. I know no mode of recognition that
can add a tittle of weight to it.” Catching the tone
of his asseveration, I respond that I know no form of
statement, nor process of reasoning, which can make
it more clear, that this is an absolute and wanton surrender
of the rights of the north and the rights of
humanity.</p>

<p>But I hold the Texan resolutions to have been utterly
void; and proceed to give the reasons for my
opinion.</p>

<p>I begin by quoting Mr. Webster against himself. In
an address to the people of the United States, emanating
from the Massachusetts Anti-Texas state convention,
held January 29th, 1845, the subjoined passage, which is<span class="pagenum" id="Page_267">[Pg 267]</span>
understood, or rather, I may say, is now well known,
to have been dictated by Mr. Webster himself, may be
found:—</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>“But we desire not to be misunderstood. According to
our convictions, there is no power in any branch of the government,
or all its branches, to annex foreign territory to this
Union. We have made the foregoing remarks only to show,
that, if any fair construction could show such a power to exist
any where, or to be exercised in any form, yet the manner
of its exercise now proposed is <i>destitute of all decent semblance
of constitutional propriety</i>.”</p>
</div>

<p>Thus cancelling the authority of Mr. Webster in
1850 by the authority of Mr. Webster in 1845, I proceed
with the argument.</p>

<p>Though the annexation of Texas was in pursuance
of a void stipulation, yet it is a clear principle of law,
that when a contract void between the parties, has
been <i>executed</i> by them, it cannot then be annulled. If
executed, it becomes valid, not by virtue of the contract
but by virtue of the execution. I bow to this
legal principle, and would fulfil it. But any independent
stipulation which remains unexecuted, remains
invalid. Such is that part of the annexation resolutions
which provides for the admission of a brood of
Texan states. The resolutions themselves say, in express
terms, that the new states are to be admitted
“under the provisions of the federal constitution;”
and the federal constitution says, “New states may be
admitted <i>by the Congress</i> into this Union.” By what
Congress? Plainly, by the Congress in session at the
time when application for admission is made; and by
no other. The fourth Texan state may not be ready
for admission for fifty years to come; and could the
Congress of 1845 bind the Congress of 1900? The
Congress of 1900, and all future Congresses, will derive
their authority from the constitution of the United
States, and not from any preceding Congress. Put the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_268">[Pg 268]</span>
case in a negative form. Could the Congress of 1845
bind all future Congresses <i>not</i> to admit new states, and
thus, <i>pro tanto</i>, annul the constitution? Positive or
negative, the result is the same. No previous Congress,
on such a subject, can enlarge or limit the power
of a subsequent one. Whenever, therefore, the question
of a new Texan state comes up for consideration,
the Congress <i>then in being</i> must decide it on its
own merits, untrammelled by any thing their predecessors
have done; and, especially, free from a law which,
while similar in spirit, is a thousand times more odious
in principle than statutes of mortmain.</p>

<p>Admitting that a future Congress, on such a subject,
might be bound by a <i>treaty</i>, I answer that there was
no treaty; while the fact that a treaty clause was
introduced into the resolutions, in the Senate, for the
sake of obtaining certain votes that would never otherwise
have been given in their favor, and under an express
pledge from the Executive that the method by
treaty should be adopted, which pledge was forthwith
iniquitously broken by the President, leaves no element
of baseness and fraud by which this proceeding was
not contaminated. In the name of the constitution,
then, and of justice, let every honest man denounce
those resolutions as void alike in the forum of law and
in the forum of conscience; and, admitting Texas
herself to be in the Union, yet, when application is
made for any new state from that territory, let the
question be decided upon the merits it may then
possess.</p>

<p>And was not Mr. Webster of the same opinion, when,
in Faneuil Hall, in November, 1845, after the resolutions
of annexation had passed, he made the following
emphatic, but unprophetic, declaration:—</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>“It is thought, it is an idea I do not say how well founded,
that there may yet be a hope for resistance to the consummation
of the act of annexation. I can only say for one, that<span class="pagenum" id="Page_269">[Pg 269]</span>
<i>if it should fall to my lot to have a vote on such a question</i>,
<span class="smcap">and I vote for the admission into this Union of ANY
State with a constitution which prohibits even the
Legislature from ever seeing the bondmen free</span>, I
SHALL NEVER SHOW MY HEAD AGAIN, DEPEND
UPON IT, IN FANEUIL HALL.”</p>
</div>

<p>There is another objection to any future claim of
Texas to be divided into states, which grows out of
her own neglect to fulfil the terms and spirit of the
agreement. In the “territory north of the Missouri
compromise line, slavery or involuntary servitude, (except
for crime,) shall be prohibited.” So reads the
bond. But if Texas suffer slavery to be extended
over that part of her territory, then, when it becomes
populous enough for admission, and is overspread with
slavery, a new state may present a free constitution, be
admitted by Congress, and before the slaves have time
to escape, or to carry the question of freedom before the
judicial tribunals, <i>presto!</i> this free constitution will
be changed into a slave constitution, under the alleged
right of a state to decide upon its own domestic institutions;
and thus the word of promise, which was
kept to the ear, will be broken to the hope. If Texas
meant to abide by the resolutions of annexation, and
to claim any thing under them, it was her clear and imperative
duty forthwith to pass a law, securing freedom
to every inhabitant north of the compromise line. In
this way only can the resolutions be executed in their
true spirit. That territory is now in the condition
of an egg. It is undergoing incubation. From it a
state is hereafter to be hatched; but before promising
to accept the chick, it would be agreeable to know
whether a viper had impregnated the egg.</p>

<p>There is a still further objection, of whose soundness
I have no doubt; but should I be in error in regard
to it, the mistake will not invalidate any other
argument. The parties to that agreement stipulated<span class="pagenum" id="Page_270">[Pg 270]</span>
on the ground of mutuality, without which all contracts
are void. Some states were to be admitted to
strengthen the hands of slavery, and some of freedom.
A line of demarcation was drawn. Now, on investigation,
I believe it will most conclusively appear that
there is not an inch of Texan territory north of the
stipulated line. It all belongs to New Mexico, as much
as Nantucket or Berkshire belongs to Massachusetts.
It was a mistake on the part of the contracting parties;
if, on the part of Texas, it was not something worse
than a mistake. The mutuality, then, fails. The
contract is <i>nudum pactum</i>. Texas can give nothing
for what she was to receive; and is, therefore, entitled
to receive nothing but what she has got.</p>

<p>In regard to “the business of seeing that fugitives
are delivered up,” Mr. Webster says, “My friend at
the head of the judiciary committee, [Mr. <span class="smcap">Butler</span>,
of South Carolina,] has a bill on the subject now before
the Senate, with some amendments to it, which I propose
to support, with all its provisions, to the fullest
extent.”</p>

<p>Here is Mr. Butler’s bill, with Mr. Mason’s amendments:—</p>

<div class="blockquot">
<p class="center">
A BILL<br>
</p>

<p><i>To provide for the more effectual execution of the 3d clause of the 2d section
of the 4th article of the Constitution of the United States.</i></p>

<p><i>Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of the United
States of America in Congress assembled</i>, That when a person held to
service or labor in any state or territory of the United States, under
the laws of such state or territory, shall escape into any other of the
said states or territories, the person to whom such service or labor
may be due, his or her agent or attorney, is hereby empowered to
seize or arrest such fugitive from service or labor, and take him or
her before any judge of the circuit or district courts of the United
States, or before any commissioner, or clerk of such courts, or marshal
thereof, or any postmaster of the United States, or collector of
the customs of the United States, residing or being within such state
wherein such seizure or arrest shall be made, and upon proof to the
satisfaction of such judge, commissioner, clerk, marshal, postmaster,
or collector, as the case may be, either by oral testimony or affidavit<span class="pagenum" id="Page_271">[Pg 271]</span>
taken before and certified by any person authorized to administer an
oath under the laws of the United States, or of any state, that the
person so seized or arrested, under the laws of the state or territory
from which he or she fled, owes service or labor to the person claiming
him or her, it shall be the duty of such judge, commissioner, clerk,
marshal, postmaster, or collector, to give a certificate thereof to such
claimant, his or her agent or attorney, which certificate shall be a
sufficient warrant for taking and removing such fugitive from service
or labor to the state or territory from which he or she fled.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Sec. 2.</span> <i>And be it further enacted</i>, That when a person held to service
or labor, as mentioned in the first section of this act, shall escape
from such service or labor, as therein mentioned, the person to whom
such service or labor may be due, his or her agent or attorney, may
apply to any one of the officers of the United States named in said
section, other than a marshal of the United States, for a warrant to
seize and arrest such fugitive, and upon affidavit being made before
such officer, (each of whom for the purposes of this act is hereby
authorized to administer an oath or affirmation,) by such claimant, his
or her agent, that such person does, under the laws of the state or
territory from which he or she fled, owe service or labor to such
claimant, it shall be, and is hereby made, the duty of such officer, to
and before whom such application and affidavit is made, to issue his
warrant to any marshal of any of the courts of the United States to
seize and arrest such alleged fugitive, and to bring him or her forthwith,
or on a day to be named in such warrant, before the officer issuing
such warrant, or either of the officers mentioned in said first
section, except the marshal to whom the said warrant is directed,
which said warrant or authority the said marshal is hereby authorized
and directed in all things to obey.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Sect. 3.</span> <i>And be it further enacted</i>, That upon affidavit made as
aforesaid by the claimant of such fugitive, his agent or attorney, after
such certificate has been issued, that he has reason to apprehend that such
fugitive will be rescued by force from his or their possession, before he
can be taken beyond the limits of the state in which the arrest is
made, it shall be the duty of the officer making the arrest to retain
such fugitive in his custody, and to remove him to the state whence
he fled, and there to deliver him to said claimant, his agent or attorney.
And to this end, the officer aforesaid is hereby authorized and
required to employ so many persons as he may deem necessary to
overcome such force, and to retain them in his service so long as circumstances
may require. The said officer and his assistants, while so
employed, to receive the same compensation and to be allowed the
same expenses as are now allowed by law for transportation of criminals,
to be certified by the judge of the district within which the arrest
is made, and paid out of the treasury of the United States: <i>Provided</i>,
That, before such charges are incurred, the claimant, his agent
or attorney, shall secure to said officer payment of the same, and in
case no actual force be opposed, then they shall be paid by such
claimant, his agent or attorney.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Sec. 4.</span> <i>And be it further enacted</i>, When a warrant shall have been
issued by any of the officers under the second section of this act, and<span class="pagenum" id="Page_272">[Pg 272]</span>
there shall be no marshal or deputy marshal within ten miles of the
place where such warrant is issued, it shall be the duty of the officer
issuing the same, at the request of the claimant, his agent or attorney,
to appoint some fit and discreet person, who shall be willing to act as
marshal, for the purpose of executing said warrant; and such person
so appointed shall, to the extent of executing said warrant, and detaining
and transporting the fugitive named therein, have all the
power and authority, and be, with his assistants, entitled to the same
compensation and expenses provided in this act in cases where the
services are performed by the marshals of the courts.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Sec. 5.</span> <i>And be it further enacted</i>, That any person who shall knowingly
and willingly obstruct or hinder such claimant, his agent or attorney,
or any person or persons assisting him, her, or them, in so serving or
arresting such fugitive from service or labor, or shall rescue such
fugitive from such claimant, his agent or attorney, when so arrested,
pursuant to the authority herein given or declared, or shall aid, abet,
or assist such person so owing service or labor to escape from such
claimant, his agent or attorney, or shall harbor or conceal such person,
after notice that he or she was a fugitive from labor, as aforesaid,
shall, for either of the said offences, forfeit and pay the sum of one
thousand dollars, which penalty may be recovered by and for the
benefit of such claimant, by action of debt in any court proper to
try the same, saving, moreover, to the person claiming such labor or
service, his right of action for, or on account of, the said injuries, or
either of them.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Sec. 6.</span> <i>And be it further enacted</i>, That when said person is seized or
arrested, under and by virtue of the said warrant, by such marshal,
and is brought before either of the officers aforesaid, other than the
said marshal, it shall be the duty of such officer to proceed in the case
of such person, in the same way as he is directed and authorized to
do when such person is seized and arrested by the person claiming
him, or by his or her agent or attorney, and is brought before such
officer under the provisions of the first section of this act.</p>
</div>


<div class="blockquot">

<p class="center caption">AMENDMENTS</p>

<p>Intended to be proposed by Mr. Mason to the bill (Senate, 23) to provide
for the more effectual execution of the third clause of the second
section of the fourth article of the Constitution of the United
States.</p>

<p>At the end of section 5, add:</p>

<p>And any person or persons offending against the provisions of this
section, to be moreover deemed guilty of a misdemeanor, or of obstructing
the due execution of the laws of the United States, and upon
conviction thereof shall be fined in the sum of one thousand dollars,
one half whereof shall be to the use of the informer; and shall also
be imprisoned for the term of twelve months.</p>

<p>At the end of section 6, add:</p>

<p>And in no trial or hearing under this act shall the testimony of such
fugitive be admitted in evidence.</p>
</div>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_273">[Pg 273]</span></p>

<p>It will be observed that the first section of the bill,
after constituting the judges of the courts, the seventeen
thousand postmasters, the collectors, &amp;c., tribunals,
<i>without appeal</i>, for the delivery of any body,
who is sworn by any body, any where, to be a fugitive
slave, refers to the before-mentioned officers in the
words “residing or <i>being</i> within such state where such
seizure or arrest is made.” That is, the judge, postmaster,
collector, &amp;c., need not be an inhabitant of the
state, or hold his office in the state where the seizure is
made; but it is sufficient if he is such officer any where
within the United States. Mr. Butler or Mr. Mason,
therefore, may send the postmaster of his own city or
village into Massachusetts, with an agent or attorney,
who brings his affidavit from South Carolina or Virginia,
in his pocket; the agent or attorney may arrest
any body, at any time, carry him before his accomplice,
go through with the judicial forms, and hurry him to
the south; the officer, after his judicial functions are
discharged, turning bailiff, protecting the prey and
speeding the flight!</p>

<p>Still further; this bill derides the trial by jury, secured
by the constitution. A man may not lose a horse
without a right to this trial; but he may his freedom.
Mr. Webster spoke for the south and for slavery; not
for the north and for freedom, when he abandoned this
right. Such an abandonment, it would be impossible
to believe of one who has earned such fame as defender
of the constitution; it would be more reasonable to
suppose the existence of some strange misapprehension,
had not Mr. Webster, with that precision and strength
which are so peculiarly his own, declared his determination
to support this hideous bill, “with all its
provisions to the fullest extent,” when, at the same
moment, another bill, of which he took no notice, was
pending before the Senate, introduced by Mr. Seward,
of New York, securing the invaluable privilege of a
jury trial.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_274">[Pg 274]</span></p>

<p>I disdain to avail myself, in a sober argument, of the
popular sensitiveness on this subject; and I acknowledge
my obligations to the constitution while it is suffered
to last. But still I say, that the man who can
read this bill without having his blood boil in his
veins, has a power of refrigeration that would cool the
tropics.</p>

<p>I cannot doubt that Mr. Webster will yet see the
necessity of reconsidering his position on this whole
question.</p>

<p>Mr. Webster says, “It is my firm opinion, this day,
that within the last twenty years as much money has
been collected and paid to the abolition societies, abolition
presses, and abolition lecturers, as would purchase
the freedom of every slave, man, woman, and
child, in the State of Maryland, and send them all to
Liberia.”</p>

<p>The total number of slaves in Maryland, according
to the last census, amounted to 89,405. At $250
apiece,—which is but about half the value commonly
assigned to southern slaves by southern men,—this
would be $22,373,750. Allowing $30 each for transportation
to Liberia, without any provision for them
after their arrival there, the whole sum would be
$25,058,600,—in round numbers, twenty-five millions
of dollars! more than a million and a quarter in each
year, and about thirty-five hundred dollars per day. I
had not supposed the abolitionists had such resources
at their command!</p>

<p>I have dwelt thus long upon Mr. Webster’s speech,
because in connection with his two votes in favor of
Mr. Foote’s committee of compromise, which votes,
had they been the other way, would have utterly defeated
the committee, it is considered to have done
more to jeopard the great cause of freedom in the territories,
than any other event of this disastrous session.
I have spoken of Mr. Webster by name, and, I trust, in<span class="pagenum" id="Page_275">[Pg 275]</span>
none but respectful terms. I might have introduced
other names, or examined his positions without mentioning
him. I have taken what seemed to me the
more manly course; and if these views should ever by
chance fall under his eye, I believe he has magnanimity
enough to respect me the more for the frankness I
have used. If I am wrong, I will not add to an error
of judgment the meanness of a clandestine attack. If
I am right, no one can complain; for we must all bow
before the majesty of truth.</p>

<p>I have now noticed the principal events which have
taken place in Congress, and which have led to what
military men would call the “demoralization” of
many of the rank and file of its members. Some recent
movements have brought vividly to mind certain
historical recollections in regard to the African slave
trade, now execrated by all civilized nations. When
the immortal Wilberforce exposed to public gaze the
secrets of that horrid traffic, his biographer says, “The
first burst of generous indignation promised nothing less
than the instant abolition of the trade, but <i>mercantile</i>
jealousy had taken the alarm, and the defenders of the
West India system found themselves strengthened by
the independent alliance of <i>commercial</i> men.”—<i>Life of
Wilberforce</i>, vol. i. p. 291.</p>

<p>Again; opposition to Wilberforce’s motion “arose
amongst the Guinea <i>merchants</i>,”—“reënforced, however,
before long by the great body of West India
planters.”—<i>Ibid.</i></p>

<p>The corporation of Liverpool spent, first and last,
upwards of £10,000 in defence of a traffic which even
the gravity and calmness of judicial decisions have
since pronounced “infernal.”</p>

<p>“Besides printing works in defence of the slave trade
and remunerating their authors; paying the expenses
of delegates to attend in London and watch Mr. Wilberforce’s
proceedings, they pensioned the widows of<span class="pagenum" id="Page_276">[Pg 276]</span>
Norris and Green, and voted plate to Mr. Penny, for
their exertions in this cause.”—<i>Ibid.</i> p. 345.</p>

<p>It is said, that the corporation of Liverpool, at this
time, “believed firmly that the very existence of the
city depended upon the continuance of the traffic.”
Look at Liverpool now, and reflect what greater rewards,
even of a temporal nature, God reserves for men
that abjure dishonesty and crime.</p>

<p>All collateral motives were brought to bear upon the
subject, just as they are at the present time. The
Guinea trade was defended “as a nursery for seamen.”—<i>Ibid.</i>
p. 293.</p>

<p>Even as late as 1816, the same class of men, in the
same country, opposed the abolition of “white slavery”
in Algiers, from the same base motives of interest. It
was thought that the danger of navigating the Mediterranean,
caused by the Barbary corsairs, was advantageous
to British commerce; because it might deter
the merchant ships of other nations from visiting it.
After Lord Exmouth had compelled the Algerines to
liberate their European slaves, he proceeded against
Tunis and Tripoli. In giving an account of what he
had done, he defends his conduct “upon general principles,”
but adds, “as applying to our own country,
[Great Britain,] it may not be borne out, <i>the old mercantile
interest being against it</i>.”—<i>Osler’s Life of Exmouth</i>, p. 303.</p>

<p>So after Admiral Blake, in the time of Cromwell,
had attacked Tunis, he says, in his despatch to Secretary
Thurloe, “And now seeing it hath pleased God
soe signally to justify us herein, I hope his highness
will not be offended at it, nor any who regard duly the
honor of the nation, <i>although I expect to have the
clamors of</i> <span class="allsmcap">INTERESTED MEN</span>.”—<i>Thurloe’s State Papers</i>,
vol. ii. p. 390.</p>

<p>And is commerce, the daughter of freedom, thus forever
to lift her parricidal hand against the parent that<span class="pagenum" id="Page_277">[Pg 277]</span>
bore her? Are rich men forever to use their “thirty
pieces of silver,” or their “ten thousand pounds sterling,”
or their hundreds of thousands of dollars, to reward
the Judases for betraying their Savior? Viewed
by the light of our increased knowledge, and by our
more elevated standard of duty, the extension of
slavery into California or New Mexico, at the present
time, or even the sufferance of it there, is a vastly
greater crime than was the African slave trade itself, in
the last century; and I would rather meet the doom
of posterity, or of heaven, for being engaged in the
traffic then, than for being accessory to its propagation
now.</p>

<p>Let those who aid, abet, or connive at slavery extension
now, as they read the damning sentence which
history has awarded against the actors, abettors, and
connivers of the African trade, <i>but change the names</i>,
and they will be reading of themselves. Should our
new territories be hereafter filled with groaning bondmen,
should they become an American Egypt, tyrannized
over by ten thousand Pharaohs, it will be no
defence for those who permitted it, to say, “We hoped,
we supposed, we trusted, that slavery could not go
there;” Nemesis, as she plies her scorpion lash, will
reply, “<i>You might have made it certain</i>.”</p>

<p>On this great question of freedom or slavery, I have
observed with grief, nay, with anguish, that we, at the
north, break up into hostile parties, hurl criminations
and recriminations to and fro, and expend that strength
for the ruin of each other, which should be directed
against the enemies of liberty; while, at the south,
whenever slavery is in jeopardy, all party lines are
obliterated, dissensions are healed, enemies become
friends, and all are found in a solid column, with an
unbroken front. Are the children of darkness to be
forever <i>so much</i> wiser than the children of light? In
the recent choice of delegates for the Nashville convention,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_278">[Pg 278]</span>
I have not seen a single instance where Whig
and Democrat have not been chosen as though they
were Siamese twins, and must go together. But here
it often happens, that as soon as one party is known to
be in favor of one man, this preference alone is deemed
a sufficient reason why another party should oppose him.
Why can we not combine for the sacred cause of freedom,
as they combine for slavery? No thought or desire
is further from my mind than that of interfering
with any man’s right of suffrage; but if, (which is by
no means impossible, nor perhaps improbable,) the fate
of New Mexico should be decided by one vote, and my
vote should have been the cause of a vacancy in any
Congressional district that might have sent a friend to
freedom, I should say, with Cain, “My punishment is
greater than I can bear.”</p>

<p>On the subject of the present alienation and discord
between the north and the south, I wish to say that I
have as strong a desire for reconciliation and amity as
any one can have. There is no <i>pecuniary</i> sacrifice
within the limits of the constitution, which I would
not willingly make for so desirable an object. Public
revenues I would appropriate, private taxation I would
endure, to relieve this otherwise thrice-glorious republic
from the calamity and the wrong of slavery. I
would not only resist the devil, but if he will flee from
me, I will build a bridge of gold to facilitate his escape.
I mention this to prove that it is not the value, <i>in
money</i>, of territorial freedom, for which I contend, but
its value <i>in character</i>, <i>in justice</i>, <i>in human happiness</i>.
While I utterly deny the claim set up by the south,
yet I would gladly consent that my southern fellow-citizens
should go to the territories and carry there
every kind of property which I can carry; I would
then give to the Southern States their full share
of all the income ever to be derived from the sales of
the public lands, or the leasing of the public mines;<span class="pagenum" id="Page_279">[Pg 279]</span>
and whatever, after this deduction, was left in the public
treasury, should be appropriated for the whole nation,
as has been the practice heretofore. That is, in
consideration of excluding slavery from the territories,
I would give the south a double share, or even a three-fold
share, of all the income that may ever be derived
from them. Pecuniary surrenders I would gladly make
for the sake of peace, but not for peace itself would I
surrender liberty.</p>

<p>It would be to suppose our merchants and manufacturers
void of common foresight, could they believe
that concession now will bring security hereafter. By
yielding the moral question, they jeopard their pecuniary
interests. Should the south succeed in their
present attempt upon the territories, they will impatiently
await the retirement of General Taylor from the
executive chair, to add the “State of Cuba,” with its
500,000 slaves, its ignorance and its demoralization, to
their roll of triumph. California will be a free-trade
state, by the most certain of all biases. They will
have nothing to sell but gold; they will have every
thing to buy,—cradles and coffins, and all between.
If New Mexico is slave, it will also be free trade; and
Cuba as certainly as either,—though in that island facilities
for smuggling will reduce the difference between
tariff and free trade to nothing. A surrender, therefore,
by our northern business men, will be most disastrous
to the very business that tempts them to surrender.
Will they take no warning from the fact that their
apathy in regard to Texas repealed the tariff of 1842?
This is a low motive, I admit; but it may be set as a
back-fire to the motive by which some of them appear
to be influenced. There was no need, not a shadow
of need, of perilling any principle, nor any interest.
Had the north stood firm, had they been true to the
great principles they have so often and so solemnly
proclaimed, the waves of southern violence would have<span class="pagenum" id="Page_280">[Pg 280]</span>
struck harmless at their feet. He is not learned in the
weather who does not know that storms from the south,
though violent, are short. We are assailed now because
we have yielded before. The compromise of
1820 begat the nullification of 1832; the compromise
of 1832 inspired the mad exploit of compassing Texas,
which our greater madness made sane. The moral
paralysis which failed to oppose the Mexican war, has
given us the territories. If the territories are now surrendered,
we shall have Cuba, and an indefinite career
of conquest and of slavery will be opened on our south-western
border. Every new concession transfers
strength from our side to the side of our opponents;
and if we cannot arrest our own course when we are
just entering the rapids, how can we arrest it when we
come near the verge of the cataract? The south may
rule the Union, but they cannot divide it. Their
whole Atlantic seaboard is open to attack, and powerless
for defence; and the Mississippi River may as easily
be divided physically as politically into independent
portions. With these advantages, let us never aggress
upon their rights, but let us maintain our own.</p>

<p>Fellow-citizens, I would gladly relieve the darkness
of this picture by some gleams of light. There are
two hopes which, as yet, are not wholly extinguished
in my mind. Beyond all question, a compromise bill
will be reported by the committee of thirteen, in which
free California will be made to carry as great a burden
of slavery as she can bear. It is still <i>possible</i> that the
House will treat, as it deserves, this adulterous union.
A single vote may turn the scale, and Massachusetts
may give that vote. Not improbably, too, the fate of
the bill may depend upon the earnestness and decision
with which northern constituencies make their sentiments
known to their representatives, whether by petitions,
by private letters, or by public resolutions. Let
every lover of freedom do his best and his most.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_281">[Pg 281]</span></p>

<p>Should the north fail, I have still one hope more.
It is, that New Mexico will do for herself what we
shall have basely failed to do for her. If both these
hopes fail, our country is doomed to run its unobstructed
career of conquest, of despotism, and of infamy.</p>

<p>I have now, my fellow-citizens, given you my
“Views and Opinions” on the present crisis in our
public affairs. Had I regarded my own feelings, I
should have spoken less at length; but the subject has
commanded me. I trust I have spoken respectfully
towards those from whom I dissent, while speaking
my own sentiments justly and truly. I have used no
asperity; for all my emotions have been of grief, and not
of anger. My words have been cool as the telegraphic
wires, while my feelings have been like the lightning
that runs through them. The idea that Massachusetts
should contribute or consent to the extension of human
slavery!—is it not enough, not merely to arouse the
living from their torpor, but the dead from their graves!
Were I to help this, nay, did I not oppose it with all
the powers and faculties which God has given me, I
should see myriads of agonized faces glaring out upon
me from the future, more terrible than Duncan’s at
Macbeth; and I would rather feel an assassin’s poniard
in my breast than forever hereafter to see “the air-drawn
dagger” of a guilty memory. In Massachusetts,
the great drama of the revolution began. Some
of its heroes yet survive amongst us. At Lexington,
at Concord, and on Bunker Hill, the grass still grows
greener where the soil was fattened with the blood of
our fathers. If, in the providence of God, we must
be vanquished in this contest, let it be by force of the
overmastering and inscrutable powers above us, and
not by our own base desertion.</p>

<h2>LETTER II.</h2>

</div>
<div class="blockquot">

<p><span class="smcap">To the Editors of the Boston Atlas</span>;</p>
</div>

<p><span class="smcap">Gentlemen</span>; Your semi-weekly of the 1st instant
contains a letter of the Hon. Daniel Webster, to certain
citizens of Newburyport, in which he has been pleased
to refer to me, and particularly to a passage in the letter
which I addressed to a portion of my constituents,
on the 3d of May last, [the preceding Letter.] His
reference to me is of so extraordinary a character, both
as to manner and matter, that I wish to reply. To
prevent all chance of mistake, I quote the following
passages:—</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>“But, at the same time, nothing is more false than that
such jury trial is demanded in cases of this kind by the constitution,
either in its letter or in its spirit. The constitution
declares that in all criminal prosecutions there shall be a
trial by jury. The claiming of a fugitive slave is not a criminal
prosecution.</p>

<p>“The constitution also declares that in suits at common law
the trial by jury shall be preserved; the reclaiming of a fugitive
slave is not a suit at the common law; and there is no
other clause or sentence in the constitution having the least
bearing on the subject.</p>

<p>“I have seen a publication by Mr. Horace Mann, a member
of Congress from Massachusetts, in which I find this sentence.
Speaking of the bill before the Senate, he says:
‘This bill derides the trial by jury secured by the constitution.
A man may not lose his horse without a right to this trial, but
he may lose his freedom. Mr. Webster speaks for the south
and for slavery, not for the north and for freedom, when he
abandons this right.’ This personal vituperation does not<span class="pagenum" id="Page_283">[Pg 283]</span>
annoy me, but I lament to see a public man of Massachusetts
so crude and confused in his legal apprehensions, and so little
acquainted with the constitution of his country, as these opinions
evince Mr. Mann to be. His citation of a supposed
case, as in point, if it have any analogy to the matter, would
prove that, if Mr. Mann’s horse stray into his neighbor’s field,
<i>he cannot lead him back without a previous trial by jury to
ascertain the right</i>. Truly, if what Mr. Mann says of the
provisions of the constitution in this publication be a test of
his accuracy in the understanding of that instrument, he would
do well not to seek to protect his peculiar notions under its
sanction, but to appeal at once, as others do, to that higher
authority which sits enthroned above the constitution and
above the law.”</p>
</div>

<p>I must deny this charge of “personal vituperation;”
nothing was further from my thoughts; and
I regret that Mr. Webster, while disclaiming “annoyance”
at what I said, should betray it. I believe
every part of my “Letter” to be within the bounds
of courteous and respectful discussion. There is nothing
in it which might not pass between gentlemen,
without interrupting relations of civility or friendship.
Though full of regret at his novel position, and of dissent
from his unwonted doctrines, yet it abounds in
proofs of deference to himself. I must now, however,
be permitted to add that the highest eminence becomes
unenviable when it breeds intolerance of dissent, or
bars out the humblest man from a free expression of
opinion.</p>

<p>Mr. Webster “laments to see a public man of Massachusetts
so crude and confused in his legal apprehensions,
and so little acquainted with the constitution of
his country, as these opinions evince Mr. Mann to be.”
Yet he points out no error of opinion. He specifies
nothing as unsound. Judgment and condemnation alone
appear. He seems to have taken it for granted that he
had only to say I was guilty, and then proceed to punish.
I protest against and impugn this method of proceeding,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_284">[Pg 284]</span>
by any man, however high, against any man, however
humble.</p>

<p>When Mr. Webster penned his “lamentations” over
my crudeness, confusion, and ignorance, he doubtless
meant to deal me a mortal blow. The blow was certainly
heavy: but the question still remains, <i>whether
it hit</i>. Polyphemus struck hard blows, but his blindness
left the objects of his passions unharmed.</p>

<p>But wherein do those erroneous “opinions” consist,
which Mr. Webster does not deign to specify, but assumes
to condemn? Fortunately, in writing the sentence
which he quotes for animadversion, I followed
the precise meaning of Judge Story, as laid down in
his Commentaries; and in regard to the only point
which is open to a question, <i>I took the exact words</i> of
that great jurist. He speaks of “the right of a trial
by jury, in civil cases,” as an existing right <i>before</i> the
seventh article of amendment to the constitution,
which <i>preserves this right</i> “in suits at common law,”
had been adopted. (3 Comm., 628.) Instead of transcribing
Judge Story’s words, “in civil cases,” which
present no distinct image to common minds, I supposed
the every-day case of litigation respecting a horse,
which is a “civil case;” and this difference of form
is the only difference between my language and that
of the learned judge. I can wish Mr. Webster no
more fitting retribution, after reposing from this ill-tempered
attack upon me, than to awake and find that
it was Judge Story whom he had been maligning.</p>

<p>Does not the authority of Judge Blackstone also
support my position? He says,—</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>“Recapture or reprisal is another species of remedy, by
the mere act of the party injured.... But as the public
peace is a superior consideration to any one man’s private
property; and as, if individuals were once allowed to use
private force as a remedy for private injuries, all social justice
must cease, the strong would give law to the weak, and<span class="pagenum" id="Page_285">[Pg 285]</span>
every man would revert to a state of nature; for these reasons,
it is provided that this natural right of recaption shall
never be exerted, where such exertion must occasion strife
and bodily contention, or endanger the peace of society. If,
for instance, my horse is taken away, and I find him in a
common, a fair, or a public inn, I may lawfully seize him to
my own use; but I cannot justify breaking open a private
stable, <i>or entering on the grounds of a third person, to take
him</i>, should he be feloniously stolen; <i>but must have recourse
to an action at law</i>.”—<i>Comm.</i> 4, 5.</p>
</div>

<p>But the opinion expressed by me on this point does
not need the authority of any name to support it; and
the illustration which I gave is not only intelligible to
every sensible man, but is also apposite. I said “a man
may not lose his horse, [i. e. his property in a horse,]
without a right to this trial.” Mr. Webster’s comment
is, that this case, “if it have any analogy to the matter,”
means, that if a man’s horse “<i>stray</i> into his neighbor’s
field, <i>he cannot lead him back without a previous
trial by jury to ascertain the right</i>.” Was ever the
plain meaning of a sentence more exactly changed
about, end for end? Mr. Webster may pitch somersets
with his own doctrines, but he has no right to
pitch them with mine. I said a man may not <i>lose</i> his
horse, or his property in a horse, without a right to the
trial by jury. He says I said, a man cannot <i>find</i> or
<i>retake</i> a lost horse, without a previous trial! <i>Dulce
est desipere in loco.</i> Or, it is pleasant to see a grave
senator play upon words;—though there should be
some wit to redeem it from puerility.</p>

<p>But the childishness of this criticism is not its worst
feature. What is the great <i>truth</i> which Mr. Webster
and his apologists attempt here to ridicule? It is
this: While every man amongst us, in regard to any
piece of property worth more than twenty dollars, of
which violence or fraud may attempt to despoil him,
has a right to a trial by jury; yet a man’s freedom,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_286">[Pg 286]</span>
and that of his posterity forever, may be wrested from
him, as our law now stands, without such a trial.
Does not this hold a man’s freedom to be of less value
than twenty dollars? If two adverse claimants contest
title to an alleged slave, whose market value is
more than this sum, each is entitled to a jury to try
the fact of ownership. But if the alleged slave declares,
here, in Massachusetts, that he owns himself, he
is debarred from this right. And this truth, or a common
illustration of it, Mr. Webster and his apologists
think a suitable topic for sneers or pleasantry! A
French proverb says, that for a man to kill his mother
<i>is not in good taste</i>. I trust the moral and religious
people of Massachusetts have too much <i>good taste</i> to
relish jokes on such a theme.</p>

<p>Again; I said that Mr. Butler’s bill “derides” the
trial by jury. By that bill every commissioner and
clerk of a United States court, every marshal and collector
of the customs, and the seventeen thousand
postmasters of the United States, are severally invested
with jurisdiction and authority in all parts of the
United States, to deliver any man, woman, or child
in the United States, into custody, as a slave, on the
strength of an <i>ex parte</i> affidavit, made any where in
the United States. This affidavit may have been
made a thousand miles off, by no one knows whom,
and certified to by a person who never saw or heard
of the individual named in it. A forged affidavit, or
a fictitious affidavit, would often answer the purpose as
well; for how difficult, and in many cases, how impossible,
to prove its spuriousness. Did oppression ever before
conceive such a tribunal, so countless in numbers, so
ample in jurisdiction, so terrible in power? Had a
bill similar to this been proposed in the British Parliament,
from 1763 to 1776, what would our fathers have
said of it? Yet this bill, with some kindred amendments,
heightening its features of atrocity, Mr. Webster<span class="pagenum" id="Page_287">[Pg 287]</span>
promised “to support, with all its provisions, to the
fullest extent.”</p>

<p>What aggravates the wrong, is, that the cruelties of
the measure will fall upon the poor, the helpless, the
ignorant, the unfriended. The bill would have been
far less disgraceful, had its provisions borne upon the
men who should pass it; because, in such case, there
would have been a touch of equality. Now, if this
bill does not “<i>deride</i>” all guaranties for the protection
of human liberty, it is only because my word of
reprobation is too weak. It is only because one needs
“to tear a leaf from the curse-book of Pandemonium”
in order to describe it by fitting epithets.</p>

<p>Another remarkable feature of Mr. Butler’s bill is,
that it provides no penalty whatever for any one who
shall abuse, or fraudulently use, the dangerous authority
which it gives. It furnishes endless temptations
and facilities for committing wrong; it imposes no
restraints; it warns by no threats of retribution.</p>

<p>Mr. Webster calls me to account for some unspecified
erroneous “opinion,” expressed in relation to this bill.
Can any opinion be so false to the constitution, as this
bill to humanity? I deprecate error of all sorts; but
hold it to be more venial to err in judgment than in
heart.</p>

<p>I said that in promising to support Mr. Butler’s bill,
“with all its provisions, to the fullest extent,” Mr.
Webster “abandoned” the right to a trial by jury. I
spoke of him as a senator, as one who, with his co-legislators,
was bound, in fulfilment of his constitutional
duty, to secure this form of trial to the alleged slave,
or to a known freeman seized as a slave. Mr. Seward’s
bill, providing for the trial by jury, in such cases, was
before him. He took no notice of it. He passed by
“on the other side,” while he bestowed his best encomium
on Mr. Butler’s bill, by promising to support it.
Was not this an “abandonment,” under any of the
synonyms given in the dictionary?</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_288">[Pg 288]</span></p>

<p>Mr. Webster advises me, in a certain contingency,
“to appeal to that higher authority which sits enthroned
above the constitution and above the law.” I
take no exception to this counsel, because of its officiousness,
but would thank him for it. My ideas of
duty require me to seek anxiously for the true interpretation
of the constitution, and then to abide by it,
unswayed by hopes or fears. If the constitution
requires me to do any thing which my sense of duty
forbids, I shall save my conscience by resigning my
office. I am free, however, to say, that if, in the discharge
of my political duties, I should transfer my
allegiance to any other power, I should adopt Mr.
Webster’s ironical advice, and go to the power “which
sits enthroned above,” rather than descend to that
opposite realm, whence the bill he so cordially promised
to support must have emerged.</p>

<p>I wish, however, to remark, that though I acknowledge
the constitution to be my guide while under oath
to support it, yet I do not relish this fling either at the
powers above us, or at those who reverence them. I
hold it to be not only proper, but proof of sound moral
and religious feeling, to look to the perfect law of God
for light to enable us more justly to interpret the
imperfect laws of man. Especially, when we are
proposing to make or amend a law, ought we to take
our gauge of purpose and of action from the highest
standard.</p>

<p>Noy, that Solomon of the law, thought it not improper
to say, “The inferior law must give place to
the superior; man’s laws to God’s laws.”—<i>Maxims</i>,
pp. 6, 7.</p>

<p>“The law of Nature,” says Blackstone, “being coeval
with mankind, and dictated by God himself, is,
of course, superior in obligation to any other. It is
binding all over the globe; in all countries, at all times.
No human laws have any validity, if contrary to this;<span class="pagenum" id="Page_289">[Pg 289]</span>
and such of them as are valid, derive all their force
and all their authority, mediately or immediately, from
this original.”—1 <i>Com.</i> 41.</p>

<p>Fortescue, the Chancellor of Henry VI., in his <i>De
Laudibus Legum Angliæ</i>, cap. 42, has the following
passage, the consideration of which, in requital for
Mr. Webster’s advice to me, I respectfully commend
to him:—</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>“That must necessarily be adjudged a cruel law, which
augments slavery, and diminishes liberty. For human
nature implores, without ceasing, for liberty. Slavery is
introduced by man, and through his vice. But liberty is the
gift of God to man. Wherefore, when torn from a man, it
ever yearns to return; and it is the same with every thing
when deprived of its natural liberty. On this account, that
man is to be adjudged cruel, who does not favor liberty. By
these considerations the laws of England, in every case,
give favor to liberty.”</p>
</div>

<p>Having defended my own propositions, I shall now
take the liberty to examine some of Mr. Webster’s;
and, in so doing, I shall examine the constitutional
provisions for trial by jury, and fortify my opinion by
historical references. I shall consider,</p>

<p>I. <i>Where Congress has power to provide for such
trial.</i></p>

<p>II. <i>Where it is the duty of Congress to do so.</i></p>

<p>Mr. Webster says “the constitution declares, that
in all criminal prosecutions, there shall be a trial by
jury;” and that “in suits at common law the trial
by jury shall be preserved.” He then adds, “There
is no other clause or sentence in the constitution having
the least bearing upon the subject.” Mark his
words: “There is no other clause or sentence in the
constitution, <i>having the least bearing on the subject</i>.”
This I deny.</p>

<p>Here Mr. Webster virtually declares that, but for the
above-named two provisions, the right of the trial by<span class="pagenum" id="Page_290">[Pg 290]</span>
jury would not have been secured to us by the constitution
<i>in any case</i>. Of course, in the absence of these
provisions, Congress would have been under no obligation,
nor would it, indeed, have had any power, to
provide by law for such trials.</p>

<p>Were I to say that this assertion borders on the
incredible, one might well ask, Which side of the line
does it lie?</p>

<p>The provision for a trial by jury, <i>in criminal prosecutions</i>,
is in the third clause of the second section of
the third article, and is repeated, and somewhat enlarged,
in the fifth and sixth articles of amendment.</p>

<p>But the provision for trial by jury, <i>in suits at common
law</i>, is in the seventh article of amendment; and
neither this provision, nor any semblance of it, is to
be found, in express words, in any part of the constitution
as it came from the hands of its framers, and
was adopted by the states.</p>

<p>According to Mr. Webster, then, Congress was under
no obligation, and had no power, to make a law providing
for trial by jury, <i>except in criminal prosecutions</i>,
until <i>after</i> the seventh article of amendment had been
ratified; for if they had any such power, or were under
any such obligation, it must be by virtue of some
clause or sentence in the constitution, <i>having a “bearing
upon the subject.”</i></p>

<p>Now, the first session of Congress commenced
March 4th, 1789, but this seventh article of amendment
was not ratified, and did not become a part of
the constitution, according to Hickey, (Hickey’s Const.
p. 36,) until December 15, 1791.</p>

<p>Until this time, therefore, according to Mr. Webster,
the constitution had secured no right to a trial by jury,
except in the case of <i>criminal prosecutions</i>; because,
until this time, there was no clause or sentence in it
“having the least bearing on the subject” of jury trials
in any but criminal cases.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_291">[Pg 291]</span></p>

<p>Yet, on the 24th of September, 1789, <i>and more than
two years previous to the adoption of the seventh
amendment</i>, (by which alone, according to Mr. Webster,
they had any power to act in the premises,)
Congress did pass the judiciary act; by the ninth,
twelfth, and thirteenth sections of which it is provided,
that the trial of issues in fact, in the district courts, in
the circuit courts, and in the supreme court, shall,
with certain exceptions, be by jury.</p>

<p>The act also empowers the courts to grant new
trials “for reasons for which new trials have usually
been granted in the courts of law.” In what courts of
law? Did it not mean the courts in Westminster Hall,
and those in this country formed after that ancestral
model? And does not this show beyond question or
cavil, that the principle of the jury trial, <i>in civil cases</i>, was
incorporated into the constitution of the United States,
originally; and that it was universally understood to
be so by its framers, and by their contemporaries, the
members of the first Congress?</p>

<p>From the constitution alone, then, and not from any
power above it, or outside of it, did Congress derive
its power, on the 24th of September, 1789, and more
than two years before the seventh amendment was
adopted, to pass the judiciary act, and to fill it full of the
fact and the doctrine of jury trials in civil cases. And
if Congress, at that time, had legislated on the subject
of fugitive slaves, would it not have had the same power
to provide the trial by jury, to determine the question,
slave or free, as it had to provide for this mode of trial
in other cases?</p>

<p>All the state conventions for adopting the constitution,
whose debates are preserved, and all the leading
men who figured in them, held,—contrary to Mr.
Webster,—that the third article in the constitution,
providing for courts, carried jury trials in civil cases
with it. Mr. Marshall, afterwards Chief Justice Marshall,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_292">[Pg 292]</span>
said in the Virginia convention, “Does the word
<i>court</i>, [in the constitution,] only mean the judges?
Does not the determination of a jury necessarily lead
to the judgment of the court? Is there any thing
which gives the judges exclusive jurisdiction of matters
of fact? What is the object of a jury trial? To
inform the court of the facts. When a court has cognizance
of facts, does it not follow that they can make
inquiry by a jury? It is impossible to be otherwise.”—3
<i>Elliott’s Debates</i>, 506.</p>

<p>The third article in the Virginia bill of rights was
as follows:—</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>“In controversies respecting property, and in suits between
man and man, the ancient trial by jury is preferable to any
other, and ought to be held sacred.”</p>
</div>

<p>This article being read in the convention, Judge
Marshall said <i>the trial by jury was as well secured by
the United States constitution, as by the Virginia bill
of rights</i>.—Ib. 524. He said this in reference to
civil cases.</p>

<p>In the Massachusetts convention, it was said, without
a doubt’s being expressed from any quarter, that
“the word <i>court</i> does not, either by popular or technical
construction, exclude the use of a jury to try facts.
When people in common language talk of a trial at
the court of common pleas, or the supreme judicial
court, do they not include all the branches and members
of such courts, the jurors as well as the judges?
They certainly do, whether they mention the jurors
expressly or not. Our state legislators have construed
the word court in the same way.”—2 <i>Elliott’s Debates</i>,
127.</p>

<p>Such was the doctrine maintained by the leading
minds of the state conventions; by Christopher Gore,
in Massachusetts; by Judge Wilson, and Chief Justice
McKean, in Pennsylvania; by Chief Justice Marshall,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_293">[Pg 293]</span>
Judge Pendleton, and Mr. Madison, in Virginia; by
Judge Iredell, in North Carolina, and many other distinguished
names.</p>

<p>In the Virginia convention, objection was made to
the constitution because it did not <i>expressly</i> secure to
the accused the privilege of challenging or excepting
to jurors in criminal cases. But Mr. Pendleton,
the President of the convention, and for so many years
afterwards the highest judicial officer in the state, replied:
“When the constitution says that the trial shall
be by jury, does it not say that every incident will go
along with it?”—3 <i>Elliott’s Debates</i>, 497.</p>

<p>So when the constitution provided for “courts,” and
defined their jurisdiction, it clearly contemplated the
trial by jury, in regard to all such rights of the citizen
as had been usually, theretofore, tried by a jury. Congress,
indeed, might fail to perform its duty; but in
such case, no provisions of the constitution, however
express and peremptory, would secure the rights of the
people.</p>

<p>It is perfectly well known to every student of the
constitution, that the only reason why that instrument
did not make <i>express</i> provision for the trial by jury, in
civil cases, was the difficulty of running the dividing
line between the many cases that should be so tried,
and the few that should not. All were agreed that
ninety-nine per cent. of all civil cases should be tried
by jury; but they could not agree upon the classes of
cases from which the remaining one per cent. should
be taken.</p>

<p>In this connection, it is worth while to notice the
heading or preamble of the joint resolutions for submitting
certain proposed amendments of the constitution
to the states, among which was the seventh. It
is as follows:—</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>“The conventions of a number of the states having at
the time of their adopting the constitution expressed a desire,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_294">[Pg 294]</span>
in order to prevent misconstruction or abuse of its powers,
that further declaratory or restrictive clauses should be added;
and as the extending the ground of public confidence in the
government will best insure the beneficent ends of its institution,
<span class="smcap">Resolved</span>,” &amp;c.</p>
</div>

<p>From this it appears that the first Congress only proposed
to submit certain “<i>further declaratory and restrictive
clauses</i>,” which were “to prevent misconstruction
or abuse of its powers.” This heading or
title, of course, does not enlarge or limit the meaning
of the amendments; but it shows the view which their
authors had of their scope and intendment. And what
is the seventh amendment but a “declaratory and
restrictive clause,” securing the trial by jury, in cases
at common law, “where the value in controversy shall
exceed twenty dollars,” and abandoning it where the
value is less?</p>

<p>The phraseology of the amendment is full of significance:
“The right of trial by jury shall be preserved.”
Not created, but preserved. Not instituted
<i>de novo</i>, but continued. Will Mr. Webster tell me,
how a right can be <i>preserved</i>, which does not already
<i>exist</i>?</p>

<p>In speaking of the trial by jury, in criminal cases,
Judge Story uses the same word. He says it was
“preserved.” In neither class of cases, civil or criminal,
was it ever abandoned or lost, through the fault of the
constitution. If not always enjoyed by the citizen, it
has been through the dereliction of Congress in not
passing the requisite laws.</p>

<p>The great men who submitted this seventh amendment
to the states, treated the trial by jury, in civil cases,
as a then subsisting constitutional right. They passed a
law to put the practical enjoyment of this right into the
hands of the people, well knowing that there is scarcely
a right which we hold under the constitution which we
can beneficially possess or use, without the intervention
of some law, as its channel or medium.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_295">[Pg 295]</span></p>

<p>Suppose this seventh amendment had never been
adopted, on what ground would the trial by jury, in
civil cases, have rested up to the present day? Could
it have been taken from us all, in all cases except criminal
ones, by any corrupt Congress?</p>

<p>In asserting, therefore, that, besides the references
he has made, there is not another “clause or sentence
in the constitution, <i>having the least bearing on the
subject</i>” of jury trials, Mr. Webster is contradicted by
the members of the general convention, by the state
conventions, by the senators and representatives, who
passed the judiciary act, by President Washington who
signed it, and by all the judges who administered that
act until the seventh amendment was adopted.</p>

<p>II. <i>Where it is the duty of Congress to provide for
trial by jury.</i></p>

<p>But another of Mr. Webster’s assertions is still more
extraordinary. He says “nothing is more false than
that such jury trial, [a trial by jury for an alleged
slave, or for a freeman claimed as a slave,] is demanded
by the constitution, either in its letter or in its spirit.”</p>

<p>I make a preliminary remark upon the grossness
of the error embodied in the form of this proposition.</p>

<p>“<i>Nothing is more false</i>;” that is, if I, or any one,
had affirmed that our constitution forbids trial by jury,
in all cases, under penalty of death; or that it creates
an hereditary despotism; or that it establishes the
Catholic religion, with the accompaniment of an inquisition
for each state; or that it does all these things together;
it would not be more “<i>false</i>” to the “<i>spirit</i>”
of the constitution, than to say that it demands the
trial by jury, when a man who is seized as a slave, but
who asserts that he is free, invokes its protection.</p>

<p>But this pertains to the <i>form</i> only of his assertion,
and is immaterial to the argument. I proceed to inquire
whether its substance be not as indefensible as
its form.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_296">[Pg 296]</span></p>

<p>In another part of Mr. Webster’s letter, he says, that
he sees “no objection to the provisions of the law”
of 1793. Of course; for he sees no objection to Mr.
Butler’s bill, and its amendments; but prefers them to
Mr. Seward’s. And he now says, there is nothing in
the letter or in the “spirit” of the constitution,
which demands the jury trial for an alleged slave, or
for a freeman captured and about to be carried away
as a slave.</p>

<p>Feeble and humble as I am, great and formidable as
he is, I join issue with him on this momentous question,
and put myself upon the country.</p>

<p>Our constitution, as the present generation has always
been taught, yearns towards liberty and the
rights of man. The trial by jury, in the important
cases of life, liberty, and property, is essential to these
rights. The two, therefore, have such close affinity
for each other, as to render it highly probable, if not
morally certain, that the framers of the former would
make provision for the latter; that they would lay
hold of it, as by a law of instinct, to carry out their
beneficent purposes. The trial by jury was necessary
to the vitality of the constitution; and, I think, it
would not be too strong an expression to say that the
constitution, as it came from the hands of its founders,
necessitated the trial by jury.</p>

<p>The object for which the constitution was framed,
as set forth in its preamble,—namely, to “establish
justice,” “promote the general welfare,” and “secure
the blessings of liberty,” to the people,—could never
be accomplished without the trial by jury. The preamble
is not appealed to as a source of power; but it
touches, as by the finger, the objects which it contemplated;
it suggests the means by which its beneficent
purposes were to be fulfilled, and it indicates the rules
of interpretation by which all its provisions are to be
expounded.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_297">[Pg 297]</span></p>

<p>And not only the objects for which the constitution
professes to exist, but historical facts from the time of
Magna Charta, and before that time; the practice of
the English and of our Colonial and Provincial courts
before the revolution and during the confederacy;—in
fine, all analogies and tendencies of constitutional
law, and whatever belongs to ideas of freedom, conspire
to force the expectation upon us, that, in a matter
of such vast concernment as the life-long liberty or
bondage of a man and his offspring, it has <i>not</i> left us
without the right of trial by jury.</p>

<p>The very first law “for the general good of the
colony of New Plymouth,” (1623,) was, “that all
criminal acts, and also all matters of <i>trespasses</i> and
<span class="allsmcap">DEBTS</span>, between man and man, should be tried by the
verdict of twelve honest men.”</p>

<p>In that fearful array of crimes which the Declaration
of Independence charges home upon the king of
Great Britain, that sublime instrument enumerates the
following as among the most flagitious: “For depriving
us, in many cases, of the benefits of trial by jury,”
and “for protecting his troops, <i>by a mock trial</i>, from
punishment for any murders which they should commit
on the inhabitants of these states.”</p>

<p>According to Blackstone, the right to a trial by jury
had been held, “time out of mind,” to be the birthright
of Englishmen. The 29th chapter of the Great
Charter guarantied this right, not only in cases of liberty,
life, and limb, but in cases of property, real and
personal.</p>

<p>In England, it has become a traditional saying, and
drops from the common tongue, that the great object
of king, lords, and commons, is to get twelve men
into the jury box.</p>

<p>Judge Story says, “When our more immediate ancestors
removed to America, they brought this great
privilege with them, <i>as their birthright and inheritance</i>,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_298">[Pg 298]</span>
as a part of that admirable common law which had
fenced round, and interposed barriers on every side,
against the approaches of arbitrary power. It is now
incorporated into all our state constitutions, as a fundamental
right; and the constitution of the United States
would have been justly obnoxious to the most conclusive
objection, if it had not recognized and confirmed
it in the most solemn terms.”—3 <i>Com.</i> 652, 3.</p>

<p>Is it conceivable, then, that the heroes and sages of
the revolution, who rose in resistance to the most formidable
power on earth; so many of whom rose
against their own kindred in the mother country, because
they loved liberty better than father or mother,
or brother or sister, and who endured the privations and
horrors of a seven years’ war;—is it conceivable, I
say, that, when they had achieved their independence,
and there was no longer any earthly power to control
them, they should have framed a fundamental law, and
should not have imbued that law with the “<i>spirit</i>” of
the trial by jury, as its breath of life? As British subjects,
they were entitled to this trial. As Americans,
did they renounce it? Did they wage war for seven
years in order to place themselves in a worse condition
than they had been placed in by their “tyrant”? Mr.
Webster says they did. He charges this infinite folly
and blindness upon them, singly and collectively, one
and all.</p>

<p>I will now fortify this historical view, by a reference
to some decisions of the supreme court which explain
and define the meaning of the seventh amendment.<a id="FNanchor_10" href="#Footnote_10" class="fnanchor">[10]</a></p>

<p>What is the true meaning of those descriptive words,
“suits at common law”? Has not Mr. Webster, relying
on his high reputation, disposed of this matter a
little too summarily? He says, “The constitution<span class="pagenum" id="Page_299">[Pg 299]</span>
declares that in suits at common law, the trial by jury
shall be preserved;” but he adds, “The reclaiming of
a fugitive slave is not a suit at common law.”</p>

<p>But the supreme court of the United States has
furnished us with an authoritative interpretation of the
words of the constitution bearing on this subject. In
the case of <i>Cohens</i> <span class="smcap">vs.</span> <i>Virginia</i>, 6 Wheaton, R. 407,
they define what is meant by a “suit.” These are
their words:—</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>“What is a <i>suit</i>? We understand it to be the prosecution,
or pursuit, of some <i>claim</i>, demand, or request. In law language,
it is the prosecution of some demand in a court of
justice. ‘The remedy for every species of wrong is,’ says
Judge Blackstone, ‘the being put in possession of that right
whereof the party injured is deprived,’ The instruments
whereby this remedy is obtained are a diversity of <i>suits</i> and
actions, which are defined by the Mirror to be ‘the lawful demand
of one’s right;’ or, as Bracton and Fleta express it in
the words of Justinian, ‘<i>jus prosequendi in judicio quod
alicui debetur</i>,’—(the form of prosecuting in trial, or judgment,
which is due to any one.) Blackstone then proceeds to
describe every species of remedy by suit; and they are all
cases where the party suing claims to obtain something to
which he has a right.</p>

<p>“To commence a suit is to demand something by the institution
of process in a court of justice; and to prosecute the
suit is, according to the common acceptation of language, to
continue that demand.”</p>
</div>

<p>According to the supreme court, then, a <i>suit</i> is the
prosecution of some <i>claim</i>, demand, or request. Now,
the proceedings for a fugitive slave, according to the
very letter of the constitution, are instituted to prosecute
a <i>claim</i>. The person held to service or labor is
to be delivered up, “on <i>claim</i> of the party to whom
such service or labor may be due.”</p>

<p>Still further, in a decision bearing directly on the
right to a trial by jury, the supreme court have defined
the term “common law” in special reference to its<span class="pagenum" id="Page_300">[Pg 300]</span>
meaning in the amendment to the constitution, which
secures this right “in suits at common law.” These
are their words:—</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>“It is well known that in civil causes, in courts of equity
and admiralty, juries do not intervene; and that courts of
equity use the trial by jury only in extraordinary cases, to inform
the conscience of the court. When, therefore, we find
that the [7th] amendment requires that the right of trial by
jury shall be preserved, in suits at common law, the natural
conclusion is, that this distinction was present to the minds of
the framers of the amendment. By <i>common law</i> they meant
what the constitution denominated in the third article ‘law;’
not merely suits which the <i>common</i> law recognized among its
old and settled proceedings; but suits in which <i>legal</i> rights
were to be ascertained and determined, in contradistinction to
those in which equitable rights alone were recognized, and
equitable remedies were administered, or in which, as in the
admiralty, a mixture of public law, and of maritime law and
equity, was often found in the same suit. Probably there
were few, if any, states in the Union, in which some new legal
remedies, differing from the old common law forms, were
not in use; but in which, however, the trial by jury intervened,
and the general regulations in other respects were according
to the course of the common law. Proceedings in cases of
partition, and of foreign and domestic attachment, might be
cited as examples variously adopted and modified. <i>In a just
sense, the amendment, then, may well be construed to embrace
all suits, which are not of equity or admiralty jurisdiction</i>,
<span class="allsmcap">WHATEVER MAY BE THE PECULIAR FORM WHICH THEY MAY
ASSUME TO SETTLE LEGAL RIGHTS</span>.”—<i>Parsons</i> <span class="smcap">vs.</span> <i>Bedford</i>, 3
<i>Peters’s Rep.</i> 456, 7.</p>
</div>

<p>The last sentence I have underscored. In this sentence,
the supreme court plainly say, that, if the
subject matter of the litigation, or the object of the
proceeding, be to determine a “legal right” which was
formerly determined by a “suit at common law,” then
such proceeding is embraced in the seventh amendment,
and either party in interest has a right to the
trial by jury. Now, is it not clear that any proceeding<span class="pagenum" id="Page_301">[Pg 301]</span>
which determines whether a man owns himself, or is
owned by another man, and which delivers one man
into the custody of another, as his slave, or refuses so
to deliver him, is, “whatever peculiar form it may assume,”
a proceeding “to settle a legal right,”—the
highest legal right? It is not a right in equity, in admiralty,
or under the maritime law; but strictly and
exclusively a <i>legal right</i>, and nothing else. According
to the doctrine of the supreme court, then, in the above-cited
case, the parties to such a proceeding have a
right, under the seventh amendment, to a trial by jury.
At least, is not such the “<i>spirit</i>” of the amendment?</p>

<p>But there is another well-known fact, which gives
pertinence and stringency to the above view. At common
law, the writ <i>de homine replegiando</i>,—the writ
of personal replevin, or for replevying a man,—was
an original writ; a writ which the party could sue out
of right; one to be granted on motion, without showing
cause, and which the court of chancery could not
supersede. It was, according to the very language of
our supreme court, recognized by the common law
“among its old and settled proceedings.” The form
of it is found in that great arsenal of common law
writs, the <i>Registrum Brevium</i>. A man, says Comyn,
may have a <i>homine replegiando</i> for a negro; or for an
Indian brought by him into England and detained from
him; or it may be brought by an infant against his
testamentary guardian; <i>or by a villein against his lord</i>.
(Dig., Title Imprisonment, L. 4.)</p>

<p>If it could be brought by a villein against his lord,
then it was the very writ for an alleged slave against
an alleging owner. It was the mode provided by the
common law for the determination of the <i>legal right</i>
asserted in a human being. I have always understood
that, before the revolution, and before the framing of
our constitution, Comyn’s Digest was a work of the
highest authority. It must have been well known to<span class="pagenum" id="Page_302">[Pg 302]</span>
all the lawyers in the convention. Did they expect,
then, that when an alleged slave, or a known freeman,
should be seized, that he should be hurried into
bondage without any right to this ancient muniment
of the subject’s liberties?</p>

<p>But “the reclaiming of a fugitive slave,” says Mr.
Webster, “is not a suit at the common law.” The
proceedings provided for by the statute of 1793, to
which he “sees no objection,” have no analogy to the
writ <i>de homine replegiando</i>. But can you destroy the
right to a jury trial by changing the process? A sand-hiller
from Georgia or North Carolina cannot come to
Massachusetts and eject Mr. Webster from his Marshfield
farm without being compelled to submit the
question of title to a jury. But suppose Congress
should say, in effect, that any one of the seventeen
thousand postmasters in the United States might be
brought into Massachusetts, (and, among so numerous
a body, it is no libel to say there are some reckless
men,) and that the said sand-hiller might go before the
said imported postmaster, and after proof “to his satisfaction,”
“either by oral testimony or by affidavit,”—an
affidavit, be it remembered, taken any where in
the United States,—then the claimant shall be put
into immediate possession of the said farm, with a
right to recover costs; and suppose Mr. Webster should
spurn the authority of this illegitimate court, and demand
an observance of the ancient forms of law, and
a trial by jury under the seventh amendment; then
the claimant has only to borrow Mr. Webster’s own
words, and say, “This is not a suit at the common
law:”—suppose all this, I say, and I would then ask
if such a proceeding would be satisfactory to the last-named
gentleman? The common sense of mankind
is authority good enough to answer such a question;
but we have high legal authority in addition.</p>

<p>In <i>Baker</i> <span class="allsmcap">VS.</span> <i>Riddle</i>, Mr. Justice Baldwin, one of<span class="pagenum" id="Page_303">[Pg 303]</span>
the judges of the supreme court of the United States,
held that it was not in the power of Congress to take
away the right of trial by jury, secured by the seventh
amendment, either,—“1. By an organization of the
courts in such a manner as not to secure it to suitors;”
or,—“2. By authorizing the courts to exercise, or
their assumption of, equity or admiralty jurisdiction
over cases at law.” “This amendment,” says he,
“preserves the right of jury trial against any infringement
by any department of the government.”—<i>Baldwin’s
Rep.</i> 404.</p>

<p>Now, what was Mr. Butler’s bill but “a new organization
of the courts,” or, rather, a new creation of some
twenty thousand courts, “in such a manner as not to
secure [the right of trial by jury] to suitors?” It was,
indeed, a violation of both of the principles laid down
by Judge Baldwin. It was the creation of tribunals
unknown to the common law, and authorizing those
tribunals to decide upon rights not belonging to either
“equity or admiralty jurisdiction.”</p>

<p>In this connection, I will refer to the case of <i>Lee</i> <span class="allsmcap">VS.</span>
<i>Lee</i>, 8 <i>Peters’s Rep.</i> 44.</p>

<p>By act of Congress of April 2, 1816, it was declared
that no cause should be removed from the circuit court
of the District of Columbia to the supreme court by
appeal or writ of error, “unless the matter in dispute
shall be of the value of one thousand dollars or upwards.”
The plaintiffs in error were claimed as slaves.
Their petition for freedom in the court below had been
decided against them; and from this decision they appealed.
The defendant in error took the objection
that they,—their bodies and souls,—were not worth
one thousand dollars, and therefore that they had no
right to appeal. But the court said,—</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>“The matter in dispute, in this case, is the freedom of the
petitioners. The judgment of the court below is against their
claims to freedom; the matter in dispute is, therefore, to the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_304">[Pg 304]</span>
plaintiffs in error, the value of their freedom, <i>and this is not
susceptible of a pecuniary valuation</i>. Had the judgment been
in favor of the petitioners, and the writ of error brought by
the party claiming to be the owner, the value of the slaves as
<i>property</i> would have been the matter in dispute, and affidavits
might be admitted to ascertain such value. But affidavits estimating
the value of freedom are entirely inadmissible; and
no doubt is entertained of the jurisdiction of the court.”</p>
</div>

<p>Now, if the supreme court of the United States, in
construing a law, felt constrained by their oaths to hold
the freedom of a man,—of any man, though he might
be a drivelling idiot, or stretched upon his death bed,
with only another hour to breathe,—to be worth more
than a thousand dollars, how can a senator of the
United States say, that in passing a law, under which
human liberty may be retained or lost, he is not bound
at least by the “<i>spirit</i>” of the constitution, if not by
its letter, to hold that human liberty to be of greater
value than twenty dollars, and therefore to provide the
trial by jury for its protection? What can prove more
strikingly that Mr. Webster violates the whole “spirit”
of the constitution, when the framers and ratifiers of
this amendment covenanted for and decreed the trial
by jury, for such a paltry sum of money; and when
the judges of the supreme court held human liberty to
be worth more than any nameable sum of money, while
he regards it as a thing to be disposed of by any corrupt
postmaster, which any corrupt administration may corruptly
appoint. Yet he says, “Nothing can be more
false than that a jury trial is demanded in cases of this
kind by the constitution, either in its letter, <i>or in its
spirit</i>.”</p>

<p>I wish I could find, or felt at liberty to coin some
milder word; but for want of a better, I must say
that Mr. Webster seems to me, throughout this whole
matter, to <i>dogmatize</i>. He makes strong assertions
without offering even weak reasons. Of this character<span class="pagenum" id="Page_305">[Pg 305]</span>
was his annunciation of the discovery of a new law,—“the
law of physical geography,”—which was to
suspend moral agency, and take from man his power
to commit crime against his brother; as though in ascending
hill-sides, freedom and slavery lie in different
atmospherical strata, and are bounded by each other impassably;
as though there were any mountain so “exceeding
high,” to whose top even Jesus Christ could
go, that Satan could not go there to tempt him. This
does not strike the common mind like a true discovery;—like
the law of gravitation, for instance, discovered
by Newton, or the existence of the planet Neptune, by
Leverrier. It is rather like that earliest pretended discovery
on record, which was designed to seduce, and
did seduce, the first parents of us all. <i>Ye may eat of
the forbidden tree, for ye shall</i> <span class="allsmcap">NOT</span> <i>surely die</i>. So Mr.
Webster says, Let slaves be driven in coffles, or carried
in ships’ holds to the new territories; they cannot
live there. Will not the results of the two experiments
bear a lively analogy to each other, and be
likely to reflect similar credit upon their authors?</p>

<p>So, too, when he tore some of the brightest pages
from the New Testament, by proclaiming that “there
is to be found no injunction against that relation [of
slavery] between man and man, in the teachings of the
gospel of Jesus Christ, or of any of his apostles”!
Upon how many Christian hearts did this sentiment
fall like an anathema against all truth. He does not
say any <i>express</i> injunction, but “no injunction;”—none
of any kind. No <i>positive</i> injunction against
slavery in the New Testament!—a book designed to
regulate our life and condition for two worlds; yet,
altogether, not so large as many a congressional report;
less voluminous than the ordinances of many of our
city governments;—a book, therefore, which, from
the necessity of the case, must deal with great and
immortal principles, and could not descend into<span class="pagenum" id="Page_306">[Pg 306]</span>
specification and detail;—and because such a book as
this contains no <i>express</i> injunction against slavery,
therefore slavery is not forbidden by it, but has the
implied approval of its silence! Surely, never was
there a more sinister, unsound, unchristian argument
uttered by infidel or pagan. Is there any <i>express</i> injunction
“in the teachings of the gospel of Jesus
Christ, or of any of his apostles,” commanding us to
declare the African slave trade piracy? Is there any
<i>express</i> injunction “in the teachings of the gospel of
Jesus Christ, or of any of his apostles,” against cannibalism?
Do they any where say, “Ye shall not eat
one another?” Yet what enormity and flagitiousness
would it be to infer, that, therefore, men and women
may turn ogres and ogresses, and eat human flesh as
they do mutton and sirloin. The inference in the
latter case is every whit as warrantable and as sound,
as in the former. Yet I consider that this theological
argument does not violate the “spirit” of the gospel,
any more than his constitutional argument violates the
“spirit” of the constitution. John Wesley, who had
lived amid slavery, denominates it the “sum of all
villanies,” and if Christ came into this world and left
it, without permeating and saturating all his teachings
with injunctions against the injustice, cruelty, pride,
avarice, lust, love of domination, and love of adulation,
which are the inseparable accompaniments of slavery,
then I think the Christian world will cry out, that so
far as this life is concerned, his mission was substantially
fruitless.</p>

    <div class="verse indent0">To bring us back these tidings of despair?”</div>
  </div>
</div>
</div>

<p>So, if the constitution of the United States contains
not even any <i>implied</i> security for the liberty of all the
colored population in the free states and territories, and
for the trial by jury as the only adequate means of<span class="pagenum" id="Page_307">[Pg 307]</span>
securing that liberty, then would it not be more creditable
to its framers never to have put their signatures
to it?</p>

<p>Let me here compare the relative value of life or
property on the one side, with liberty on the other, and
see what inference must be drawn in favor of affording
as great a protection to the latter as to the former.</p>

<p>The fifth article of amendment declares that “no
person shall be deprived of life, liberty, or property,
without due process of law.” The commentators
say that these words, “due process of law,” are
the equivalent of the phrase “the law of the land,” in
the 29th chapter of Magna Charta; and hence that
“this clause in effect affirms the right of trial according
to the process and proceedings of the common
law;” that is, by jury. (See Story’s Comm. 661; 2
Inst. 50, 51; 2 Kent’s Comm. 10; 1 Tucker’s Black.
App. 304.)</p>

<p>Now, consider that the general right of trial by
jury, in cases of <i>life</i>, was expressly secured by the
constitution as originally adopted; that, somewhat
more than three years afterwards, the same right was
expressly secured for <i>property</i>, in suits at common law,
whenever the value in controversy should exceed
twenty dollars; and then say whether there is not the
strongest implication in favor of the same right, in
cases of human liberty, which is so much more precious
than life and property combined. I do not here
say it is an implication that binds the courts in administering
a law. That is not the point under discussion.
But is it not an implication that binds the <i>legislator</i>, so
that when legislating on the subject, he cannot consciously
and wilfully abandon it without infidelity to
his oath? I do not believe that many men from the
free states will ever be found in Congress who will not
take this view of the subject. Indeed, not a few of
the best lawyers and jurists have held that the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_308">[Pg 308]</span>
implication binds the courts; and therefore that the
statute of 1793 is unconstitutional.<a id="FNanchor_11" href="#Footnote_11" class="fnanchor">[11]</a></p>

<p>Mr. Webster treats the two cases, of fugitives from
justice and fugitives from service, alike; although one
can almost adopt his own language, and say that
“nothing is more false” than that they are alike. In
regard to the first class, the constitution says, a person
“<i>charged</i>” with treason, &amp;c.; but in regard to the
second class, it says no person “<i>held</i>,” &amp;c.</p>

<p>According to the obvious intent of this language,
the alleged fugitive must be <i>proved</i> to be <i>held</i>, <i>bound</i>,
<i>obligated</i>. It is not enough that he be <i>charged</i> to be
“held” to service, though it is enough that a man be
“<i>charged</i>” with crime. To bring the first case within
the legal category of the second, its terms should be,
“a person <i>guilty</i> of treason,” &amp;c., shall be delivered
up. Were such the phraseology, would any one doubt
that proof of guilt should precede delivery, and that
there could be no other foundation for it?</p>

<p>Mr. Webster says, “perhaps the only insuperable
difficulty” to a trial by a jury, “has been created by
the states themselves.” Suppose this to be so, I would
ask whose duty is it to act first,—that of Congress to
provide the trial, or that of the states to remove the
impediment? Shall the states repeal their laws first,
and leave the liberty of the citizens in jeopardy; or
shall not Congress legislate first, and secure that liberty?
Which is of the greater importance, that the
owner should recover his slave, or that the citizen
should retain his freedom? I answer according to the
language which the criminal law uses respecting guilt
and innocence, that it is better that nine hundred and
ninety-nine, that is, an indefinite number of slaves
should escape, than that one free man should be delivered
into bondage.</p>
<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_309">[Pg 309]</span></p>
<p>Besides, I think no state legislated on the subject for
the protection of its own citizens, until 1842. This
was after Congress had neglected, for more than fifty
years, to do its duty. Why, then, should Mr. Webster
cast the blame upon the states which forbore for more
than fifty years to act protectively for themselves, when
Congress, of which he had been a leading member for
nearly forty years, had endangered, instead of securing,
the liberty of their citizens? When he said that
“every member of every northern legislature is bound
by oath to support the constitution of the United
States,” why did not the retort suddenly rise to his
mind that <i>he</i> was bound by oath not less than they;
and that his oath embraced the men that owned freedom,
not less than the men that owned slaves? Besides,
he charges only a <i>part</i> of the free states with
being guilty of unjust legislation. Shall the innocent
states suffer because of the others’ offence? Rather
shall not Congress first supply the means of protection
to the citizens of all?</p>

<p>It seems to me, too, that the fourth amendment has
an important “<i>bearing upon the subject</i>,” because it
shows that the master-thought of our fathers, in forming
the constitution, was to secure the liberties of the
citizen. It provides against “unreasonable seizures”
of “persons.” I suppose the main idea of this amendment
was to secure the citizen against “unreasonable
seizure,” even in cases where he should afterwards,
and at <i>some time</i>, be brought to trial according to the
forms of the common law. But what “seizure” can
be more “unreasonable,” than one whose object is,
not an ultimate trial, but bondage forever, without
trial? Can mortal imagination conceive of any seizure
less entitled than this to be called “reasonable?”
With what indignation did our fathers frown because
they were transported beyond seas <i>to be tried</i>; yet, by
our present law, and by the law which Mr. Webster<span class="pagenum" id="Page_310">[Pg 310]</span>
promises to support, a free man may be transported, if
not beyond seas, at least beyond lands, and beyond
states, <i>not to be tried</i>, but to be held in slavery forever
without trial. If a free citizen of Massachusetts
should be seized and plunged into a Massachusetts
prison, to be kept there for life; and his children, as a
consequence of his fate, were put into the same, or
into other prisons, as fast as they were born, to be also
kept for life; and such was the original object and
avowed purpose of the seizure, would not this conflict
a little with the “<i>spirit</i>” of the fourth amendment?
And does this proceeding conflict with this “<i>spirit</i>”
any the less, because the prison is a southern rice
swamp, or cotton field, where the nearest door or outlet
of escape is more than a hundred miles from the
spot of confinement? In common law actions, trover,
detinue, replevin, &amp;c., &amp;c., the trial is to be in the
vicinage, except there is some overpowering reason for
changing the venue, or place of trial. But here is a
transfer of the party, not for a trial, but for evading a
trial.</p>

<p>I submit, then, to the public, that here are three
provisions of the constitution, each one of which does
have “<i>a bearing on the subject</i>.” Each strengthens
the other. They form a triple implication, if not a
<i>trinoda necessitas</i>, which no man, however powerful
he may be, can break.</p>

<p>The argument which the lawyers call <i>ab inconvenienti</i>,—the
argument from inconvenience,—has been
pressed into the service of the slaveholder to endanger
the liberties of the citizen. I answer, there are two sides
to this argument; nor was it wise in the slaveholder, or
his northern friends, to suggest it. It seems to me quite
as <i>inconvenient</i> for a free man to lose his liberty, as for
a slaveholder to lose his slave. If a southern man
sues a northern one for the value of a bale of cotton
or a barrel of rice, must not the plaintiff await the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_311">[Pg 311]</span>
next term of the court before he can enter his action,
abide by the rules of the court respecting continuances,
and submit to the order of business in taking
his turn before a jury? To obviate this inconvenience,
has any legislature or any court ever proposed
to set aside or annul, at once, all the securities by
which we hold property and life? And how stands
the question respecting evidence or proof? If difficult
for a slave claimant, from Texas, to prove title to his
slave in Massachusetts, how infinitely more difficult
for a citizen of Massachusetts to prove title to himself
in Texas. But Mr. Webster says there are independent
courts at the south, “always open and ready to
receive and decide upon petitions or applications for
freedom.” Suppose this to be true; how is a man or
a woman, whose master knows that he or she is free,
to get to the courts? Mr. Webster seems to think
that as soon as a kidnapping slave dealer shall transport
his human prey to the south, he will at once take
him to, or allow him to go before a court of justice, or
will sell him to some brother Samaritan who will
do so. Does not every body know that any man, who
is capable of the enormous guilt of seizing or buying
a freeman, will make it impossible for that freeman to
regain his birthright?</p>

<p>Mr. Webster says, persuasively, that the alleged
slave “is only remitted, for inquiry into his rights, to
the state from which he fled.” But suppose he had
never “fled,” but was demeaning himself as a peaceable
citizen, under the solemnly pledged protection of
the government, on the soil where he was born! This
is the false idea that underlies the whole of Mr. Webster’s
seductive letter, that under such a bill as Mr.
Butler’s, nobody but a slave would ever be arrested.</p>

<p>I have no doubt that what Mr. Webster says about
southern courts being “fair and upright,” is very generally
and extensively true; but I have had a little<span class="pagenum" id="Page_312">[Pg 312]</span>
personal knowledge of southern courts, and I have no
hesitation in saying that there has been one, at least,
before which, if a slave were suing for his freedom,
and any popular clamor against him should exist, he
would have no more hope of obtaining his liberty
through the “fairness” of the court, than, if thrown
overboard in the middle of the Atlantic ocean, he
would have of saving his life by swimming ashore.</p>

<p>Mr. Webster holds Massachusetts up to the ridicule
of the world, because, as he says, she “grows fervid
on Pennsylvania wrongs;” and he has deemed it his
duty to inquire how many seizures of fugitive slaves
have occurred in New England within our time. Is
this the Christian standard by which to estimate the
evil of encroachments upon the most sacred rights of
men? If I repose in contentment and indifference,
because my own section, or state, or county, is as yet
but a partial sufferer, why should I not continue contented
and indifferent while I myself am safe? In
providing for the liberties of the citizen, under a common
government, I think Massachusetts worthy of all
honor and not of ridicule, because she does “grow
fervid on Pennsylvania wrongs,” and on the wrongs
of an entire race, whether in Pennsylvania or California,
or any where within the boundaries of our own
country. I see no reason why my sympathies as a
man, or the obligations of my oath as an officer, in regard
to the nearer or the remoter states, should be inversely
as the squares of the distances. Even with
regard to foreign countries, did Mr. Webster think so,
in those better days, when his eloquent appeal for oppressed
and bleeding Greece roused the nation, like the
voice of a clarion. Did Mr. Webster deem it necessary
to make inquisitions through all the New England
States, to learn how many Hungarian patriots they had
seen shot at the tap of drum, or how many noble Hungarian
women had been stripped and whipped in their<span class="pagenum" id="Page_313">[Pg 313]</span>
market places, before he thrilled the heart of the nation
at the wrongs of Kossuth and his compatriots,
and invoked the execrations of the world upon the
Austrian and Russian despots? I see no difference
between these cases, which is not in favor of our <i>home
interests</i>, of our own <i>domestic rights</i>, except the difference
of their bearings upon partisan politics and presidential
rivalries. Mr. Webster quotes and commends
Mr. Bissell, who said that those southern states which
had suffered the least from loss of slaves, made the
greatest clamor. That statement of a fact was well
put by Mr. Bissell; but was it well applied by Mr.
Webster? In the statement, it was a question as to
the loss of property. In the application, it is a question
as to the loss of liberty. The latter is not, therefore,
the “counterpart” of the former. Blindness to
the distinction between the value and the <i>principle</i> of
property, and the value and the <i>principle</i> of liberty,
could alone have permitted the comparison.</p>

<p>But I have extended this communication greatly beyond
my original purpose. Several other topics contained
in Mr. Webster’s speech, or growing out of what
has since happened in relation to it, and hardly less
important than those already considered, must await
another opportunity for discussion; unless, indeed,
some disposal of the question shall render further discussion
unnecessary.</p>

<p>I am not unmindful of the position in which I stand.
I am not unaware that circumstances have placed me
in an antagonist relation to a man whose vast powers
of intellect the world has long so vividly enjoyed and
so profoundly admired. I well know that a <i>personal</i>
contest between us seems unequal, far more than did
the impending combat between the Hebrew stripling
and that champion of the Philistines who had a helmet
of brass upon his head, and greaves of brass upon
his legs, and the staff of whose spear was like a weaver’s<span class="pagenum" id="Page_314">[Pg 314]</span>
beam. But the contest is not between <i>us</i>. It is
between truth and error; and just so certain as the
spirit of Good will prevail over the spirit of Evil, just
so certain will Truth ultimately triumph. In such a
case as this, there is one point of view in which Mr.
Webster is a desirable antagonist; for the thick and
far-beaming points of light which he has left all along
his former course of life, cannot fail to expose, to all
eyes but his own, the devious path into which he has
now wandered.</p>

</div>


<p>I had hoped not to be required to say more on the subject
discussed in the above Letters; but, during the last week,
Mr. Webster has issued, in a pamphlet form, a speech made
by him in the Senate on the 17th ult., accompanied by his
letter, dated on the same day, to some gentlemen on the
Kennebec River. In this letter, Mr. Webster has referred to
me again; and I regret exceedingly to say, that he seems to
have given himself full license to depart from all the rules of
courtesy belonging to a gentleman, and to disobey the obligations
of truth belonging to a man.</p>

<p>That I may not be supposed to make any over-statement
respecting the character of Mr. Webster’s language towards
me, as expressed in this letter, I quote a specimen or two
from it.</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>“A pamphlet has been put into circulation,” says he, referring to
the first of the above two letters, “in which it is said that my remark
is ‘undertaking to settle by mountains and rivers, and not by the Ten
Commandments, the question of human duty,’ ‘Cease to transcribe,’
it adds, ‘upon the statute book what our wisest and best men believed
to be the will of God, in regard to our worldly affairs, and the passions
which we think appropriate to devils will soon take possession
of society.’” He then adds, “One hardly knows which most to
contemn, the nonsense or the dishonesty of such commentaries on
another’s words. I know no passion more appropriate to devils than
the passion for gross misrepresentation and libel,” &amp;c., &amp;c.</p>
</div>

<p>The angry and reproachful language, in which Mr. Webster
has here indulged himself, releases me from all further
obligation to treat him with personal regard. Yet I do not
mean to avail myself of this release. Under our present
relations, however, I do feel at liberty to use considerable
plainness of speech.</p>

<p>1. Let me first refer to a misrepresentation by Mr. Webster
of a plain matter of fact. In professing to quote, from<span class="pagenum" id="Page_316">[Pg 316]</span>
his 7th of March speech, a passage on which I had made a
criticism, he alters the passage so as to evade the criticism,
and then condemns me for making it. The original passage
in his speech read as follows: “I would not take pains to
reäffirm an ordinance of Nature, nor to reënact the will of
God.” This was the sentiment I criticized. It appears in
these words in the <i>National Intelligencer</i>, in the <i>Washington
Union</i>, in the <i>Republic</i>, in the <i>Globe</i>, and in the pamphlet
edition of his speech, which he dedicated to the people of
Massachusetts. But in the Kennebec letter, in order to elude
the point of my criticism, he has interpolated a word into the
sentence, which changes its whole meaning. Affirming that
he quotes himself, he says, “I would not take pains <span class="allsmcap">USELESSLY</span>
to reäffirm an ordinance of Nature, or to reënact the
will of God.” By foisting in the word which I have underscored,
he changes the entire character of the sentiment advanced.
As now stated, nobody can dissent from it; for who
would announce, in a distinct proposition, that he would <i>uselessly</i>
do any thing? But, as originally stated, nobody can
assent to it. This alteration of his language, after my criticism
upon it was made, is not only unjust towards me, but it
contains a latent confession that he knew he was wrong, but
thought this surreptitious changing of his doctrine to be a less
evil than a frank acknowledgment of his error. Had he
truly quoted the original false sentiment, the world would
have seen that I was right; but, in his dilemma, he falsely
interpolated a true sentiment, not only to evade the force
of my criticism upon him, but to make occasion for an unfounded
imputation against me.</p>

<p>I shall not undertake to define or describe a proceeding like
this in words of my own. But I may be permitted, without
discourtesy, to use a sentiment advanced by himself, and
leave its application to be made by its author. It is in the
same connection that Mr. Webster makes the following remark:
“I know no passion more appropriate to devils than
the passion for gross misrepresentation and libel.” Can any
mortal specify a grosser instance of “gross misrepresentation
and libel” than when one of the parties to a public discussion
has uttered an obnoxious sentiment, and when this sentiment
has met with very general reprobation, and when, in the
progress of the discussion, the guilty party professes to restate<span class="pagenum" id="Page_317">[Pg 317]</span>
the case, that he should then expunge the false sentiment
he originally advanced, foist a trite and common-place one in
its stead, then apply the criticism made on the suppressed
sentiment to the forged one, and proceed to condemn his
critic for “nonsense” or “dishonesty”? Is it not as palpable
a case of alteration, as to change the date of a note of
hand in order to take it out of the statute of limitations, or to
obliterate the description of the premises in a deed, and put a
more valuable estate in its place? This proceeding is worse,
if possible, than the former “misrepresentation and libel” of
my argument and myself, contained in the Newburyport
letter. But the subject is painful, and I leave it.</p>

<p>2. Following up his attack upon me, Mr. Webster proceeds
to say:</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>“In classical times, there was a set of small but rapacious critics,
denominated <i>captatores verborum</i>, who snatched and caught at particular
expressions; expended their strength on the <i>disjecta membra</i> of
language; birds of rapine which preyed on words and syllables, and
gorged themselves with feeding on the garbage of phrases, chopped,
dislocated, and torn asunder by themselves, as flesh and limbs are by
the claws of unclean birds.”</p>
</div>

<p>May I most respectfully ask Mr. Webster on what authority
he says there was, “in classical times,” any such
“set” of “small but rapacious critics,” as he here speaks of—or
exemplifies? In my ignorance, I have always supposed
the “<i>captator</i>” of classical times, to be a kind of
“genius” the very opposite of what Mr. Webster describes.
Horace, Juvenal, and Livy represent him as a selfish, sycophantic
gift-seeker, or fortune-hunter; not a twister, torturer,
or interpolator, even, of words and phrases. If <i>captator</i>
meant a cavilling, cynical critic, then <i>captatrix</i> should mean
a scold, a vixen, or virago; but its true meaning was “a
fawning gossip,” or “mean flatterer.”</p>

<p>No mistake could well be greater than that the old <i>captatores</i>
“expended their strength on the <i>disjecta membra</i> of
language,” or “gorged themselves with the garbage of
phrases, chopped, dislocated, and torn asunder, by themselves.”
On the contrary, they were “gentle as a sucking
dove.” The accompanying words descriptive of the “<i>captator</i>”
were not <i>torve</i>, <i>ringi</i>, and so forth; but <i>collide</i>, <i>blande</i>,
or <i>blandicule</i>. There was nothing like the harpy about them,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_318">[Pg 318]</span>
as Mr. Webster seems to suppose, in this remarkable description
of his, which is as rhetorically unsavory as it is classically
untrue.</p>

<p>So far from there being any “set” of critics, in classic
times, denominated and known as <i>captatores verborum</i>, I
doubt whether even the abstract noun “<i>captatio</i>” occurs
half a dozen times, in all the classics, in connection with the
genitive of his pretended appellation. He could hardly have
made a greater or more ludicrous mistake. It is exceedingly
to be regretted, after the numerous instances we have lately
had of Mr. Webster’s bad logic, and bad humanity, and bad
discoveries of natural law, that he should now offend the
classical taste of the country, and bring discredit upon the
New England colleges, by his bad Latin. This whole anti-classical
paragraph about “<i>disjecta membra</i>,” and “chopping,”
and “gorging,” and “uncleanness,” is an unclean
conception of his own; not a pure but an impure invention,
and seems more epigastric than intellectual in its origin.<a id="FNanchor_12" href="#Footnote_12" class="fnanchor">[12]</a></p>

<p>3. I will now give a specimen or two of Mr. Webster’s
errors in geography, and of his false citation of authorities.
It will then be seen that his geographical statements are
worthy to be placed side by side with his classical. In the
same letter, he says the extent of New Mexico, north and
south, on the line of the Rio Grande, “can hardly be less
than a thousand miles.” This makes a little more than
<i>fourteen</i> degrees of latitude. Now, as its northern boundary
is in 42°, its southern must be as low as 28°. This is <i>four</i>
degrees below El Paso del Norte. Yet Mr. Webster, on the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_319">[Pg 319]</span>
13th of June last, declared himself in favor of fixing the
northern boundary of Texas at or near El Paso, and more
than four degrees of latitude north of what he here says is
the southern boundary of New Mexico. He also supported
that part of the compromise bill which proposes to give Texas,
not only these four degrees of latitude, but millions of money
also, for taking what, as he now says, belongs to New Mexico
and the United States. How can these views stand together?</p>

<p>In his 7th of March speech, Mr. Webster declared it to be
a natural impossibility that African slavery could ever exist
“in California or New Mexico.” (p. 42.) He now defines
the southern boundary of New Mexico. It can hardly be less,
says he, than “a thousand miles” from the forty-second degree
of north latitude. This places it four degrees south of
El Paso. He is in favor of that part of the bill which gives
these four degrees to Texas. According to him, therefore,
should Texas get possession of these four degrees of what
is now New Mexican territory, slavery will exist, as far up
as the old southern boundary line of New Mexico, by virtue
of the laws of Texas, but beyond this line, although within
the bounds of Texas, it will not exist, because forbidden by
the “will of God.” Hence the extraordinary spectacle will
be exhibited, of the existence of slavery coming plump up to
the south side of an imaginary line, by the laws of Texas,
while on the north side of the said imaginary line, its existence
will be cut square off by the “will of God,” although both
sides are within the same political jurisdiction. This will be
a miracle, compared with which the supposed miraculous
preservation of the Jewish feature and complexion, for two
thousand years, will be unworthy to be mentioned. It remains
to be seen, however, whether this miracle will be vouchsafed
to Mr. Webster, as a proof of the divine favor.</p>

<p>On the 5th of June, Mr. Webster voted against incorporating
the “Proviso” into the governments for New Mexico and
Utah, because slavery was already prohibited there by
“Asiatic scenery” and the law of “physical geography.”
On the next day, too, he voted against the following amendment,
offered by Mr. Walker: “And that peon servitude is
forever abolished and prohibited.” Whether he so voted because
this species of slavery, (which is an existing institution
at the present time,) was prohibited by “scenery” and
“geography,” does not appear.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_320">[Pg 320]</span></p>

<p>But on the 17th of June, Mr. Webster, in the Senate, suggested
a qualification of his doctrine as laid down on the 7th
of March, viz., that “every foot of territory of the United
States has a fixed character for slavery.” An uncertainty as
to the boundary line between New Mexico and Texas, gave
rise to this qualification. “Let me say to gentlemen,” said
Mr. Webster, “that if any portion which they or I do not believe
to be Texas, should be considered to become Texas,
then, so far, that qualification of my remark is applicable.”
(<i>Cong. Globe</i>, 31st Cong., 1st session, p. 1239.) That is, if
the compromise bill should so establish the boundary line between
New Mexico and Texas, as that “any portion [of New
Mexico] which they or I [other gentlemen or Mr. Webster,]
do not believe to be Texas, should be considered to become
Texas,” then <i>as Texan territory</i>, it might lose its “fixed
character,” and become slave territory, notwithstanding the
“ordinance of Nature” and the “will of God,” to the contrary.
But, strange to say, on this same 17th of June, the
Kennebec letter was written, which carries the southern
boundary of Mexico, on the east side of the Rio Grande, four
degrees below El Paso, and, of course, includes all that region
within New Mexico, and therefore within the “ordinance
of Nature” and the “will of God!” So that, after all, he
acknowledges that the “ordinance of Nature” and the “will
of God,” as he expounds them, may be overridden by the
laws of Texas;—in which view he is undoubtedly right.</p>

<p>But his citation of authorities is among the most surprising
of all his aberrations from fact. He first quotes Major
Gaines, who, as he says, “traversed a part of this country
during the Mexican war.” By “this country,” I suppose he
means New Mexico. If he does not mean New Mexico, then
the citation has no relation to the subject. If he does mean
New Mexico, then he asserts what is untrue. Major Gaines
did not go within four or five hundred miles of New Mexico
during the war; and if the quotation from him was designed
to create the belief that, in what Major Gaines said, he was
speaking of New Mexico, it was as gross an imposition as
could well be made.</p>

<p>The next citation is from Colonel Hardin. Two sentences
are taken. I transcribe the first with Mr. Webster’s italics.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_321">[Pg 321]</span></p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p><i>“The whole country is miserably watered; large districts have no water
at all. The streams are small, and at great distances apart.</i> One day
we marched on the road from Monclova to Parras, <i>thirty-five miles,
without water</i>; a pretty severe day’s march for infantry.”</p>
</div>

<p>And what country does this describe?</p>

<p>“From Monclova to Parras, thirty-five miles”! says
Colonel Hardin. And where is Monclova? Away down
south, in Coahuila, hundreds of miles from any part of New
Mexico.</p>

<p>I submit the following notes, one from the colonel of the
regiment in which Mr. Gaines was a major; and the other
from a major in the regiment of which Mr. Hardin was colonel.

<p>Now what possible excuse can be offered for these misleading
citations? What information would be given of the
soil of the Genesee valley of New York, by proving the condition
of the sands of Cape Cod?</p>

<p>Mr. Webster next quotes, for the second time, the letter of
Hugh N. Smith, Esq. This letter, if taken by itself, would
render it improbable, in Mr. Smith’s opinion, that slavery<span class="pagenum" id="Page_322">[Pg 322]</span>
would go into New Mexico; but it by no means proves the
physical impossibility of its existence there. But what different
language has Mr. Smith since held in his address to his
constituents in New Mexico itself? I will quote a few passages
from this address to show its general drift and intent.</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>“Your state, [New Mexico,] is threatened with dismemberment, and
<i>what is yet more fatal, the introduction of slavery into its bosom</i>.” (p. 1.)</p>

<p>“The most formidable part of this combination against you is that
which originates in the slave interest. It not only rallies against you
the whole slaveholding south, but all the influence of selfish, venal,
and ambitious men in the north, <i>looking to speculations in discredited
bonds and land jobbing, or to the political honors which the combined vote
of the south may promise</i>.” (p. 2.)</p>

<p>“The doctrine of the slaveholding states, in regard to their domestic
institutions, is non-intervention; but with regard to yours, it is
<i>instant intervention</i>, to set at nought the prohibition of slavery, which
you brought with you into the Union,” &amp;c. <i>Ib.</i></p>

<p>“I am myself a native of the section, [Mr. Smith is a Kentuckian,]
whose fate I deplore, and if my duty did not require, I would be the
last to advert to the malady that preys upon its life.... The
schemes of those who would bind you to the destiny of the slave
states, render it necessary that your representative should be excluded
from the halls of Congress.” (p. 3.)</p>

<p>“<i>You are left prostrate, that Texas may dismember and divide New
Mexico, and subject her to southern influence; that negro slavery may be introduced
into the remnant of territory that may not be appropriated to
Texas; and, finally, that the region thus secured to southern policy may
become the stock on which to graft new conquests from Mexico.</i>” (p. 4.)
[<i>These</i> are Mr. Smith’s italics.]</p>

<p>“The first step in this process is to supplant the fundamental municipal
institutions brought by New Mexico with her into the Union,
by a territorial government, which, by omitting the inhibition against
slavery in the Congressional act, failing to reserve that contained in
the Mexican code, and preventing the people of the territory from
legislating upon the subject of slavery, and from reënacting the prohibitory
clause, will unquestionably abolish all protections against
that institution; and, indeed, more effectual legislation for the extension
of slavery into New Mexico could not be enacted.” (p. 5.)</p>

<p>“The whole body of southern influence, now that mining is a
mania, would combine to pour an immense colony of slaves into New
Mexico. The consequence of this would be to level the whole population
of New Mexico with the new caste brought into competition;
and you, my Mexican fellow-citizens, who till your own soil with your
own hands, would be compelled to fly your country, or be degraded
from your equality of freemen, forfeiting your hopes of rising to the
new elevation promised by your alliance with the great North American
republic, and living only to witness the ruin of all that renders
life desirable.” (p. 6.)</p>
</div>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_323">[Pg 323]</span></p>

<p>This is what Mr. Smith says, when he writes home to his
own people, who know all about their own country, and its
danger of being invaded by slavery.</p>

<p>Now, let the reader suppose himself to have read from Mr.
Smith’s address, as much more of the same kind as the above,
and then say how far his evidence goes to sustain Mr. Webster’s
discovery, that slavery can never go into New Mexico.
Mr. Smith’s address has been published for two months; it
has been on the tables of members, published, and quoted
from in the newspapers, and yet Mr. Webster continues to
cite Mr. Smith as a witness in his favor. What influences
were used to induce Mr. Smith to withhold, in the letter to
Mr. Webster, the facts and views which he has so clearly
brought out in the letter to his constituents?</p>

<p>The next and last citation is from an officer at Santa Fe.
No name is given. We are informed neither of the character
of the author nor of his means of information; and if this
authority is as fallacious and deceptive as the preceding, it is
a great deal worse than nothing. It would be like the testimony
sometimes offered in court, which ruins the cause and
dishonors the counsel.</p>

<p>4. In his Kennebec letter, Mr. Webster says, “I have
studied the geography of New Mexico diligently, having read
all that I could find in print, and inquired of many intelligent
persons, who have been in the country, traversed it, and become
familiar with it.” He sets forth his knowledge in this
confident tone, so that his impressions in favor of the <i>natural</i>
prohibition of slavery may be more readily received. According
to this statement, he must have read the letters of
Mr. James S. Calhoun, Indian agent at Santa Fe, communicated
to Congress by the President, on the 23d of January last.
Speaking of the Navajoes, a tribe of 7,000 Indians, within the
limits of what it is proposed to include in New Mexico, Mr.
Calhoun says, that it is “not a rare instance for one individual
to possess 5,000 to 10,000 sheep, and 400 to 500 head of
other stock,” (p. 184;) and that their country “is rich in its
valleys, rich in its fields of grain, and rich in its vegetables
and peach orchards.” (p. 199.) “We encamped,” says he,
“near extensive cornfields, belonging to the Navajoes.”
(p. 197.) Their “soil is easy of cultivation, and capable of
sustaining nearly as many millions of inhabitants as they have<span class="pagenum" id="Page_324">[Pg 324]</span>
thousands.” (p. 202.) Look at this: A country owned by one
tribe capable, according to Mr. Calhoun, of sustaining nearly
7,000,000 inhabitants, and yet, as Mr. Webster avers, inaccessible
to slavery, on account of its barrenness!</p>

<p>Speaking of the Indians, (Pueblos,) on the Rio Grande, Mr.
Calhoun says, “These people can raise immense quantities
of corn and wheat, and have large herds of sheep and goats.
The grazing for cattle generally is superior.” (p. 206.) Of
the more western Pueblos, he says, they have “an extent of
country nearly four hundred miles square”;—more than
twenty times as large as Massachusetts;—“they have rich
valleys to cultivate, grow quantities of corn and wheat, and
raise vast herds of horses, mules, sheep, and goats, all of
which may be immensely increased by properly stimulating
their industry, and instructing them in the agricultural arts.”
(p. 215.)</p>

<p>I might cite much more from the same authority, to the
same effect; but I do not refer to Mr. Calhoun so much for
the purpose of showing the agricultural capabilities of New
Mexico, as of asking why Mr. Webster did not quote from
this recent official work, which has been lying on the tables
of members for months, instead of quoting descriptions from
military officers respecting a country which he well knew
they had never seen?</p>

<p>There is good reason to believe that there are wide tracts of
fertile land lying between the Sierra de los Mimbres and the
Sierra Nevada, on the east and west, and the 32d and 35th
degrees of latitude. The waters at the mouth of a river give
no doubtful indication respecting the country from which they
flow. If the volume be large, we know it must drain an extensive
region; for the waters of a great river cannot be supplied
from a narrow surface. So if the water be muddy, as
is said to be the case with that of the Colorado, it is proof
that it courses through a diluvial country. But however this
may be, all accounts concur in representing New Mexico to
be rich in mines; and mines are the favorite sphere for
slavery, as the ocean is for commerce.</p>

<p>In his late speech in the Senate, Mr. Davis, of Massachusetts,
said, that however it might be with regard to employing
slaves in New Mexico for raising crops of corn or cotton,
there was still one purpose to which they might be applied,—the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_325">[Pg 325]</span>
most odious of all purposes,—to raising crops from themselves.
From this “Southern Hive,” the markets of Texas
and Louisiana might be supplied with “vigintial” crops of
human beings. It will be incumbent on Mr. Webster to invent
some new “physical” law to meet this astute suggestion of
his colleague. “Asiatic scenery” will hardly answer his
purpose here.</p>

<p>Within the limits of the proposed territory of New Mexico,
it is said, on the authority of Humboldt, that that powerful and
comparatively civilized people, the Aztecs, once resided. Can
any person for a moment believe that the Aztecs ever grew
to opulence and power, in any such sterile and desolate region,
as Mr. Webster’s “diligent reading” portrays?</p>

<p>But what must satisfy every man whose blindness is not of
the soul rather than of the senses, is the fact that the people
of New Mexico, in the constitution which they have just
framed, have embodied a prohibition of slavery in their fundamental
law. Had slavery been forbidden there by any
“Asiatic scenery,” or by any “law of physical geography,”
who should know it better than they? They have had
slavery amongst them heretofore, and therefore they know it
can invade them again, and therefore they forbid it; and in
the choice of senators to Congress under the new organization,
should any candidate put forward the vagary, the phantasm,
the fatuity, that slavery <i>cannot</i> exist among them, they
would doubtless deem him a less fit subject for the Senate of
the United States than for sanitary treatment.</p>

<p>How stands the evidence, then, on the question, whether
“California and New Mexico,” from their geology, their geography,
or their Asiatic scenery, are inaccessible or not, to
the invasion of slavery? It is well known that the war with
Mexico was provoked, and violently precipitated upon the
country, in order to extend the domain and the power of
slavery. In negotiating for the cession of California and New
Mexico, the Mexican commissioners strove to introduce a prohibition
against slavery into the treaty. This demonstrates
that they thought slavery could exist there. Our minister declared
that he would assent to no such stipulation, though they
would cover all the land a foot thick with gold. This shows
the tenacity with which Mr. Polk’s administration, and all its
southern friends, adhered to their original purpose of obtaining<span class="pagenum" id="Page_326">[Pg 326]</span>
new territory for slavery. In view of this, the House of
Representatives again and again voted to apply the proviso to
whatever territory should be obtained. When the treaty was
ratified, many of the leading senators voted against the clause
for acquisition, foreseeing the present controversy, and hoping
to avert it. Even after the treaty was ratified, leading
southern Whigs in the House voted against paying the first
instalment under it, still clinging to the hope that the territory
might be restored to Mexico, and this cause of dissension
withdrawn. During all this period, fourteen of the northern
legislatures, many of them again and again, voted that the
proviso should be applied. The present six months’ contest,
in the Senate and House, between the north and the south, is
conducted solely on the conviction that slavery <i>may</i> exist in
the territories; and that it will or will not exist there, according
as the law allows or forbids it. Otherwise it would be the
most nonsensical and nugatory discussion ever engaged in out
of a lunatic asylum. Once make it as clear as any law of
physical nature, that slavery can never transgress the bounds
of the new territories, and there is not a man so demented
that he would any longer contend either for the proviso, or
against it. Mr. Webster was always of the same opinion, and
has declared it a hundred times. In his Marshfield speech,
September 1, 1848, he said, “He [General Cass] will surely
have the Senate, and with the patronage of the government,
with every interest that he, as a northern man, can bring to
bear, coöperating with every interest that the south can bring
to bear, we cry safety before we are out of the woods, <i>if we
feel that there is no danger</i> [of slavery] <i>as to these new territories</i>.”
Up to the 7th of March, 1850, then, when he abandoned
all the doctrines and sentiments he had ever before advocated
on this subject, and when he incurred the public, hearty approval
and encomiums of Mr. Calhoun, by his moral agility in
springing, at one leap, from Massachusetts to South Carolina;—until
this time, Mr. Webster had always held, that slavery
would invade the new territories if not barred out of them by
positive law. And what would be still more remarkable, if
the doctrines of the 7th of March speech had the least shadow
of soundness in them, is, that they have now been before
the public for more than four months, and, so far as I know,
not a single southern man has been converted by them. Are<span class="pagenum" id="Page_327">[Pg 327]</span>
not Mr. Benton, Mr. Mason, Colonel Davis, and thousands of
others, individually, as good judges, or as good witnesses, as
he is? Since the speech, the people of New Mexico have
prohibited slavery in their constitution, because they knew it
to be possible among them. Before the speech, California
did the same, and for the same reason. The Nashville convention
has just resolved, “That California is peculiarly
adapted for slave labor, and that if the tenure of slave property
was by recognition of this kind secured in that part of
the country south of 36° 30´, it would in a short time form
one or more slaveholding states, to swell the number and
power of those already in existence.” Even those who seek
to apologize for Mr. Webster, avow, at the same time, their
disbelief in his doctrine. Such is the evidence, on the one
side and on the other, as to the possibility or impossibility of
slavery in the territories. Mr. Webster is against the whole
world, and the whole world is against him, and this, too, on a
question already settled by history and experience. He is
just as much to be believed, as a man who looks up into the
clear midnight sky, and denies the existence of the heavenly
host, while all the stars of the firmament are shining down
into his eyes.</p>

<p>To increase the overwhelming proof against Mr. Webster,
I add the following:—</p>

</p>

<p>
<span class="smcap">Hon. S. R. Thurston</span>, Delegate from Oregon.<br>
</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Dear Sir</span>; In a speech delivered by you, in the House of Representatives,
in March last, I understood you to say that you had been
in the valley of the Great Salt Lake, and that you were acquainted,
from personal observation, with a large part of the territory of California.
Will you be so good as to give me your opinion, and the
reasons for entertaining it, of the probability or improbability of the
introduction of slave labor into any part of the territory recently
acquired by the United States from Mexico; provided such introduction
be not prohibited by law.</p>

<p>I wish to obtain your opinion in regard to other kinds of labor, as
well as agricultural; because, as it seems to me, a most unwarrantable,
if not a most disingenuous attempt has been made, to lead the
public to believe that no form of slave labor will ever be introduced
there, because, possibly, or probably, it may not be introduced for
agricultural purposes.</p>

<span class="smcap">Washington</span>, June 10, 1850.<br>
</p>

<p>
<span class="smcap">Hon. Horace Mann</span>;<br>
</p>

<p>I received a note from you some days ago, making certain inquiries,
but which, up to this time, I have been unable to answer. I
desire to take no part in the question now dividing the country; but
as you have asked my judgment upon a matter which appears to be
a disputed point, I cannot, consistently with the law of courtesy,
refuse you an answer. That answer will be in conformity with what
I have frequently said, heretofore, in private conversation with gentlemen
on this subject.</p>

<p>The point of inquiry seems to be, whether slave labor could be
profitably employed in Oregon, California, Utah, and New Mexico.
If the nature of the climate and resources of these countries are
such as to furnish a profitable market for slave labor, it appears to be
conceded, on all sides, that it would be introduced, if left free to seek
profitable investment, like other capital. The whole point at issue,
then, is dependent, as it is conceived, upon the determination of the
first point of inquiry. Hence, to that point, only, it is necessary for
me to confine my answer.</p>

<p>I need not remind you of the law regulating the investment of
capital. It will always go where, under all circumstances, it will
yield the greatest return to the owner. Upon this principle I am
very clear, that slave labor, if unrestricted, could be employed in
Oregon, with at least double the profit to the owner of the slave that
it now yields in any state of the Union. I am uninformed as to the
usual price of slave labor in the states, but the price paid to Indians
in Oregon during the past year, for labor, has ranged from two to
three dollars per day. Domestic negro servants, whether male or
female, who understand the business of housework, would command,
<i>readily</i>, five or six hundred dollars a year. I recollect well that there
was a mulatto man on board the vessel in which I took passage from
Oregon to San Francisco, who was paid <i>one hundred and eighty</i> dollars
per month for his services as cook. I will not stop to particularize
further, in regard to the inducements Oregon would offer to unrestricted
slave labor, but will simply add, that a very large number of
slaves might now be employed in Oregon at annual wages sufficiently
large to purchase their freedom. I think, therefore, that the point is
settled so far as Oregon is concerned, and that slave labor, if it had
been left free to seek profitable employment, would readily find its
way to that territory.</p>

<p>As to California, I am equally clear. California will always be a
mining country, and wages will range high. At present, slave labor
in California would be more profitable than in Oregon. And I have
always been of the opinion, that wherever there is a mining country,
if not in a climate uncongenial to slave labor, that species of labor
would be profitable. That it would be in the California mines, is
evident. A good able-bodied slave would have commanded, in California,
during the past year, from eight to ten hundred dollars per
annum. When it is recollected that one hundred dollars per annum,
upon an average, is considered a good compensation for their labor in
the Southern States, it is idle, in my judgment, to contend that slaves
would not be carried to the California market, if protected by law.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_329">[Pg 329]</span></p>

<p>The greatest impediment which white labor has to encounter in the
mines, is the intensity of the heat, and the prevalence of bilious disease.
The one is almost insufferable, while the other is pestilential.
Against both of these the negro is almost proof. Now, while white
labor is so high, it is evident that no one can hire a white laborer,
except at a rate that would consume his profit. Not so with negro
labor. That species of labor might be obtained for half the amount
which you would have to pay for white labor. The result would be
a profit alike to the hirer and seller of slave labor. There is no
doubt, in my judgment, that almost any number of slaves might be
hired out in California, were the whites willing to allow it, at from
eight to ten hundred dollars a year. This is pay so much above what
their services command in the states, as to satisfy any one, that could
this species of service be protected in California, it would rush to the
Pacific in almost any quantity.</p>

<p>Let us next turn our attention to Utah and New Mexico. I have
no doubt, from what knowledge I have of those countries, that they
will turn out to be filled with the richest mines. I clip the following
from a recent paper, containing the news from Texas and Chihuahua:—</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>“Mr. James was informed, by Major Neighbours and Mr. Lee Vining,
that they had been shown by Major Stein, some gold washed out by his
troops, on the Gila River, in a short excursion to that stream.</p>

<p>“It is reported, that, at the copper mines above El Paso, there are
about one hundred tons of pure copper lying upon the ground. This had
been got out by Mexicans, and abandoned when attacked by Indians.</p>

<p>“There are at El Paso, in the hands of different persons, several large
amounts of silver ore, taken from the mines in that neighborhood. With
guaranties of titles to lands, and protection from Indians, only a short
time would elapse before all these mines would be well worked, and we
would have large quantities of metal seeking a market through this place.”</p>
</div>

<p>And if you consult Fremont’s map, printed by order of the Senate
in 1848, you will find, near the source of one of the branches of the
Gila River, “copper and gold mines” laid down. And if I am not
greatly mistaken, it will turn out that the Mormons are in possession
of the richest kind of mines, east of the Sierra Nevada. It is known,
too, that silver and copper mines have, for many years, been worked
in New Mexico; and I am informed by Hugh N. Smith, Esq., that
there are, in that territory, gold, silver, copper, lead, and zinc mines
of the richest quality, and that the reason why they have not latterly
been worked more extensively is, that it is prevented by the incursions
of the Indians. He is of the opinion, and he is borne out by what history
we can get on the subject, that when these mines shall come to be
explored, their wealth will turn out to be enormous. When you have
once cast your eye over the country lying west of the Rocky Mountains,
and east of the Sierra Nevada, and are informed of the peculiarity
of the gold bearing region, you at once become convinced that
the United States is in possession of mineral wealth so vast, that ages
will not be able to measure its extent. And when these mines shall
begin to be developed, and their unquestionable richness known,
population will set that way, attended with the usual consequences,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_330">[Pg 330]</span>
high prices, and a demand for labor. If slave labor is like other capital,
if it will go where it is best paid, then we have a right to say it
will seek these mines, and become a part of the producing capital of
the country where those mines are located. That these whole regions
are filled with rich mines, is little less than certain, and that they can
be profitably worked by slave labor is sure. Hence, were I a southern
man, and my property invested in slaves, I should consider the
markets of New Mexico, Utah, and California, for slave labor, worthy
of an honorable contest to secure.</p>

<p class="right">
I am, sir, with due consideration, yours, truly,<br>
SAMUEL R. THURSTON.<br>
</p>
</div>

<p>5. The Kennebec letter has another most extraordinary and
discreditable passage. It is near the close. Mr. Webster
quotes from a speech delivered by him in the Senate, March
23, 1848, says it was published in newspapers and circulated
in pamphlet form, and that that speech contained the same
doctrines in regard to the “legal construction and effect of the
resolutions” for admitting Texas, as are contained in the
speech of the 7th of March. He says nobody complained
then, and he wonders that any body should complain now.</p>

<p>It is very remarkable that such a man as Mr. Webster
should furnish, in the very quotation which he offers, the
means of utterly confuting the assertion which he makes. I
suppose this can be accounted for only on the ground, that he
now occupies a position so antagonistic to that which he has
abandoned that he can hardly refer to his former views without
self-impeachment and self-conviction. Let passages from
the two speeches be placed side by side, to show, not their
identity, but their utter irreconcilability.</p>

<div class="blockquot">
<p class="right"><span class="smcap">March 23, 1848.</span><br>
[<i>A passage quoted by himself.</i>]<br>
</p>

<p>“It shall be <i>in the power</i> of
Congress hereafter to make <i>four</i>
other new states out of Texan
territory.”</p>

<p class="right"><span class="smcap">March 7, 1850.</span></p>

<p>“I wish it to be distinctly understood,
to-day, that, according
to my view of the matter, this
government <i>is solemnly pledged by
law and contract</i> to create new
states out of Texas,” &amp;c. (p. 42.)</p>
</div>

<p>The first quotation only asserts a “power” in Congress to
create new states; the last affirms an obligation, “by law
and contract,” to do so. How could Mr. Webster have expected
that this broad distinction between <i>power</i> and <i>duty</i>,
between <i>option</i> and <i>obligation</i>, could escape the attention of
his readers?</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_331">[Pg 331]</span></p>

<p>But there is another discrepancy or contradiction still more
remarkable:</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p class="right"><span class="smcap">March 23, 1848.</span></p>

<p>“It shall be in the power of
Congress hereafter to make <i>four</i>
other new states out of Texan
territory.”</p>

<p class="right"><span class="smcap">March 7, 1850.</span></p>

<p>“——the guaranty is, that
new states shall be made out of
it, and that such states as are
formed out of that portion of
Texas lying south of 36° 30´, may
come in as slave states to the
number of <i>four</i>, in addition to the
state then in existence.” (p. 29.)</p>
</div>

<p>The first speech speaks of the <i>power</i> of Congress, but the
last of the <i>obligation</i> of Congress, to admit new states out of
Texan territory. The first speaks of “four other new states;”
but the last of the “guaranty” to admit “<span class="allsmcap">SLAVE</span> states to the
number of four.” Yet the first speech is cited, to men who
can read and write, as identical “in legal construction and
effect” with the last. The motto under which Danton attempted
to carry himself through his bloody career, was:
“<i>L’audace, l’audace, toujours l’audace</i>.” “Audacity, audacity,
always audacity.”</p>

<p>But what else did Mr. Webster say, in his speech of the
23d of March, 1848? Referring to the debate which took
place in December, 1845, on the final act for admitting Texas,
Mr. Webster said: “And I added, that while I held, with as
much faithfulness as any citizen of the country, to all the
original arrangements and compromises of the constitution
under which we live, I never could, and I never should, bring
myself to be in favor of the admission of any states into the
Union as slaveholding states.”<a id="FNanchor_13" href="#Footnote_13" class="fnanchor">[13]</a> This is what Mr. Webster
reports himself to have said when the final vote on the admission
of Texas was immediately to be taken, and when he
commenced his speech by saying, “I am quite aware, Mr.
President, that the resolution will pass,”—meaning the resolution
for the admission of Texas. Mr. Webster’s “never
could and never should” covered the exact case of the then
contemplated future slaveholding states to be formed out of
Texas. While in the broadness of its terms it embraced all
slaveholding states, whensoever, or whencesoever they might
come, it had special and pointed application to any slave state
to be thereafter formed out of Texan territory.</p>
<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_332">[Pg 332]</span></p>
<p>In the same speech of December 22, 1845, Mr. Webster
spoke as follows:—</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>“It may be said that according to the provisions of the constitution,
new states are to be admitted on the same footing as the old states.
It may be so; but it does not follow at all from that provision that
every territory or portion of country may at pleasure establish slavery,
and then say we will become a portion of the Union; and will bring
with us the principles which we may have thus adopted, and must be
received on the same footing as the old states. It will always be a
question whether the old states have not a right, (and I think they
have the clearest right,) to require that the state coming into the
Union should come in upon an equality; and, if the existence of
slavery be an impediment to coming in on an equality, then the state
proposing to come in should be required to remove that inequality by
abolishing slavery, or take the alternative of being excluded.”</p>
</div>

<p>He also said, in the same speech, “I agree with the unanimous
opinion of the legislature of Massachusetts.”</p>

<p>And what was this “unanimous opinion of the legislature
of Massachusetts”? Among many other things equally decisive,
the Massachusetts legislature, on the 26th of March,
1845,—and, of course, long after the annexation resolutions
had been passed,—declared as follows:—</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>“And whereas the consent of the executive and legislative departments
of the government of the United States has been given, by a
resolution passed on the 27th of February last, to the adoption of preliminary
measures to accomplish this nefarious project, [the admission
of Texas, with the stipulation to admit four more states out of its
territory;] therefore, be it</p>

<p>“<i>Resolved</i>, That Massachusetts hereby refuses to acknowledge the
act of the government of the United States, authorizing the admission
of Texas, as a legal act, in any way binding her from using her
utmost exertions, in coöperation with other states, by every lawful
and constitutional measure, to annul its conditions, and defeat its
accomplishment.</p>

<p>“<i>Resolved</i>, That no territory hereafter applying to be admitted to
the Union, as a state, should be admitted without a condition that
domestic slavery should be utterly extinguished within its borders,
and Massachusetts denies the validity of any compromise whatsoever,
that may have been, or that may hereafter be, entered into by persons
in the government of the Union, intended to preclude the future application
of such a condition by the people, acting through their
representatives in the Congress of the United States.”</p>
</div>

<p>Such were the opinions which Mr. Webster then openly
expressed, and such the resolutions of the legislature of
Massachusetts, which he fully indorsed. Yet he now professes<span class="pagenum" id="Page_333">[Pg 333]</span>
to wonder that any body can see any difference
between the doctrine of those speeches and resolutions, and
those of his speech delivered on the 7th of March.<a id="FNanchor_14" href="#Footnote_14" class="fnanchor">[14]</a></p>

<p>6. A reference to a few other misstatements of facts will
close my remarks on this subject.</p>

<p>Mr. Webster says that, previous to writing his Newburyport
letter, he made “diligent inquiry,” of members of Congress
from New England, to ascertain how many arrests of fugitive
slaves had been made in their time; and he adds, “the result<span class="pagenum" id="Page_334">[Pg 334]</span>
of all I can learn is this: No seizure of an alleged slave has
ever been made in Maine.”</p>

<p>Now, two such cases have happened in the State of Maine.
One took place in the eastern part of the state, about 1835 or
’36. The other happened at or near Thomaston, a little later.
In this latter case, the fugitive came to Maine in a Thomaston
vessel, whose master was afterwards demanded as a fugitive
from justice. This demand gave rise to a prolonged correspondence,
I think, with no less than three governors of Maine.
This correspondence was extensively circulated through the
newspapers, or referred to by them, and it would seem hardly
possible that Mr. Webster should not have seen it. Since the
Newburyport letter was published, this misstatement of fact
has been noticed in the Maine newspapers, yet no retraction is
made. The misstatement is allowed to be spread over the
whole country, uncorrected by its author. Mr. Webster then
adds, “No seizure of an alleged fugitive slave has ever been
made in Vermont.” Tradition, and, as I believe, authentic
history, contradict Mr. Webster here. It is said by “members
of Congress” from Vermont, that an alleged fugitive was
carried before Judge Harrington of Vermont, in 1807, and on
his being asked what evidence would satisfy him that the person
was a slave, he replied, “A bill of sale from Almighty
God.”</p>

<p>But even if these statements of Mr. Webster, with regard
to the New England States, were all true, it would avail him
nothing; for, in the eye of patriotism, it matters not where
such seizures are made. I refer to it only to show that Mr.
Webster is not to be relied upon in these matters, either for
the accuracy of his original positions, or for a retraction of
them, when their error is pointed out by the public press. I
wish not to be understood, <i>on this particular point</i>, as imputing
to Mr. Webster an intentional misstatement; because he
accompanied his original statement with a salvo. He confessed,—and
he is entitled to the full benefit of the confession,—that
his information might not be “entirely accurate,”
though he supposed it not to be “materially erroneous.” It
is “materially erroneous;” and though one error has been
exposed in the Maine papers, he does not rectify it. Possibly
he does not know it.</p>

<p>While holding Massachusetts up to reproach for “growing<span class="pagenum" id="Page_335">[Pg 335]</span>
fervid on Pennsylvania wrongs,” Mr. Webster draws succor
and encouragement from the Society of Friends, and especially
from the Friends of Pennsylvania. He says that they remain
“of sound and disposing minds and memories;” and he contrasts
their wisdom and composure with the “vehement and
empty declarations, the wild and fantastic conduct of both
men and women which have so long disturbed and so much
disgraced the commonwealth” of Massachusetts. He then
adds, “I am misled by authority which ought not to mislead,
if it be not true, that that great body, [of Friends,] approves
the sentiments to which I gave utterance on the floor of the
Senate.” I will now show that this alleged approval by the
Friends, though worthy of any price but truth, was too dearly
bought.</p>

<p>It is well known that the Friends are divided into two great
denominations. Each has its periodical, one now in its eighth,
the other in its fourth year. In the numbers published since
the appearance of the Newburyport letter, both these periodicals
do not “approve,” but repudiate and denounce the sentiments
to which Mr. Webster gave utterance “on the floor
of the Senate.”</p>

<p>The <i>Friend’s Intelligencer</i> deals at length with Mr. Webster’s
“sentiments” on the “Fugitive Slave Bill;” on the
legislation of the north for the protection of its own citizens;
on his pseudo discoveries in “physical geography;” and on
the “legal construction and effect” of the Texas resolutions;
and it condemns them all.</p>

<p>The <i>Friend’s Review</i> dissents not less positively from Mr.
Webster’s positions; and both call him severely to account
for the defamation of themselves, which his letter implies.</p>

<p>On his “sentiments” respecting fugitive slaves, the “<i>Review</i>”
observes that they have yet to learn “that that part of
his speech was approved by any member or professor of the
society.”</p>

<p>I wish I had space to quote from these able articles, but
must forbear.</p>

<p>John G. Whittier, Esq., speaking for the Quakers of New
England, gives “a peremptory denial” to Mr. Webster’s
statement. I quote the following paragraph from him:—</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>“Now, we undertake to say that there is not a member of the Society
of Friends, in free or slave states, who, whether acting as a<span class="pagenum" id="Page_336">[Pg 336]</span>
magistrate or as citizen, could carry out the provisions of this most
atrocious bill, without rendering himself liable to immediate expulsion
from a society whose character would be disgraced, and whose
discipline would be violated, by such action. It has been, in times
past, the misfortune of the Society of Friends to be vilified, caricatured,
and misrepresented; but we remember nothing, even in the
old days of persecution, so hard to bear as the compliments of the
Massachusetts senator. Whatever his ‘authority’ may have been, we
do not hesitate to pronounce it unqualifiedly false to the last
degree.”</p>
</div>

<p>Now what shall be thought of a cause that requires such a
series of fabrications as Mr. Webster is here proved to have
made, or of the man that can make it!</p>

<p>There are many other points presented by Mr. Webster’s
speech of the 7th of March, or by what he has since said and
written to defend it, which seem to me as unwarrantable in fact,
and as reprehensible in principle, as any above enumerated. I
shall close these notes, however, with one comment more;
reserving others,—though sincerely hoping never to have
occasion to use them.</p>

<p>Among the excoriations with which Mr. Webster amused
himself and his southern new-born pro-slavery admirers, on
the 7th of March last, he flayed nobody half so deeply or so
complacently, as he did his old fellow-senators, Messrs. Dix,
of New York, and Niles, of Connecticut. He scored them to
the living flesh, and then soothed their smarting wounds by
vitriol and caustic, as though he loved them. Their agency
in the Texas swindle, he made odiously conspicuous. He
taunted them with heart-piercing innuendo for their compulsory
retirement from public life. And then he portrayed them as
occupying their enforced vacation in attempting to rouse the
people to save those regions from the curse of slavery, which,
but for their sins, never would have been exposed to it. He
worked up the scene so graphically, that every one mocked
at their contemptible plight, and at the ridiculous contrast between
the swiftness of their offence and the lameness of their
expiation. The effect was dramatic. The pro-slavery part
of the gallery and the floor responded with a shout of laughter.
Yet devoted and long-tried friends of Mr. Webster were there,
whom no darkness of blindness could prevent from seeing that
his bitter sarcasm against the ex-senators, though calculated
to make the “unskilful laugh,” must make the “judicious<span class="pagenum" id="Page_337">[Pg 337]</span>
grieve.” They could not fail to see that he, Mr. Webster
himself, at that very moment, was occupying precisely the same
pro-slavery ground, which Messrs. Dix and Niles had occupied,
when they brought in Texas and “reännexed” California and
New Mexico. He was exerting all his great talents to do an
act of precisely the same character which Messrs. Dix and
Niles had done;—that is, to open new territory to slavery.
And doubtless the first thought which arose in many a mind
was the same melancholy one which spontaneously arose in
my own, that should he succeed in arguing down, or laughing
down the “<i>Wilmot</i>” as he twice scornfully called the great
proviso of freedom; and should he then betake himself to
penitence and prayer, and by years of effort, strive to stay
back from slavery the regions he had doomed to it, he would
only have elevated himself to the very “platform” on which
Messrs. Dix and Niles stood <i>when he made them the objects of
his taunts and ridicule</i>!</p>


<div class="footnotes"><h3>FOOTNOTES:</h3>

<div class="footnote">

<p><a id="Footnote_12" href="#FNanchor_12" class="label">[12]</a> The above criticism on Mr. Webster’s latinity aroused many
self-supposed scholars, or at least fair proficients in the Latin grammar,
to take up the pen in his defence. But unluckily, the quills
they seized were plucked, not from the Roman eagle, but from the
wings of some of those “unclean birds,” to which Mr. Webster had
introduced them. Among the most conspicuous of these defenders of
Mr. Webster’s ludicrous blunder, was Professor Felton, of Harvard
College. If any person wishes to see one of the most neat, elegant,
and at the same time thorough cases of <i>deplumation</i>, any where to be
found in literary history, in which an individual who strutted on to
the stage as a <i>peacock</i>, was soon obliged to leave it as a <i>daw</i>, he has
only to read Dr. Beck’s articles in “The Literary World,” in which
the fabricated quotation of Mr. Webster, and Professor Felton’s defence
of it, are shown to be exceedingly bad as Latin, and much worse
as logic.</p>

</div>

<div class="footnote">

<p><a id="Footnote_13" href="#FNanchor_13" class="label">[13]</a> Cong. Globe, 1st session 30th Congress, p. 533.</p>

</div>

<div class="footnote">

<p><a id="Footnote_14" href="#FNanchor_14" class="label">[14]</a> Professor Stuart, in a pamphlet entitled “Conscience and the
Constitution,” pp. 78, 9, steps in to defend Mr. Webster’s position that
we are bound, by contract with Texas, to admit from her territory,
“slave states to the number of four;” and he incidentally refers
to and combats my views on this subject.</p>

<p>I respectfully submit to the revered and learned professor a
single consideration, which I trust will convince him that I am not in
error.</p>

<p>For argument’s sake, admit the contract with Texas to be unimpeachable;
although, if it be so, I see not why any one Congress may
not absorb and exhaust all the power to admit new states, which the
constitution contains, by making contracts for centuries to come, for
all the new states that shall be admitted; and for all the applications
for admission that shall be rejected. But, admitting the validity of
the Texan contract, what does it purport? That “new states,” “not
exceeding four,” “may be formed out of the territory thereof.” Those
south of 36° 30´, may be slave; that, or those, north of 36°
30´, shall be free; the whole “not exceeding four.” Here,
then, is an executory and mutual contract. It is executory; because
it is not to be executed at the time of making, but <i>in futuro</i>. It is
mutual, because, for the State of Texas, and for the one or more
slave states, south of 36° 30´, there are to be one or more free states
north of it.</p>

<p>Now, the principle is so clear that I think no one will for a moment
dispute it, that when an executory and mutual contract is to be executed,
say at four different times, each preceding act of execution
must be such as to allow of the ultimate execution of the whole.
Neither the first, second, nor third act of execution, must be so executed
as to render the fourth impossible. Neither the first, second, nor
third act, must be so executed in favor of either of the parties, as to
render the execution of the fourth, in favor of the other party, impossible.
But if Texas can have “<i>slave</i> states to the number of
<i>four</i>,” formed in succession out of her territory, then, as the whole
number to be formed is not to exceed “four,” there can be <i>no</i> free
state formed, under the alleged contract.</p>

<p>It is not within my knowledge that such an interpretation of this
supposed contract was ever suggested by any Texan citizen, or by any
southern man. I suppose it to have been advanced, <i>first</i>, by a northern
senator; and seconded, <i>first</i>, by a northern divine.</p>

Of the Ordinance of 1787, at Cleveland, Ohio.</span></p>


<p class="right">
<span class="smcap">West Newton</span>, July 9, 1849.<br>
</p>

<p>
<span class="smcap">Gentlemen</span>;<br>
</p>

<p>I have received your kind invitation to be present at
Cleveland, on the 13th inst., to celebrate the anniversary
of the great “Ordinance” which excluded slavery
forever from, and secured freedom forever to the North-western
Territory. If I could tell you how deeply I sympathize
with you in this movement, and how much my
soul desires, not merely to celebrate, but to hallow the
event, you would then believe me when I say, that I
have had a sharp struggle not to forego all considerations
of business and of health, for the purpose of joining
in your festival. I regard the Ordinance which
redeemed a territory of more than <i>two hundred and
sixty thousand square miles</i>, from the unspeakable sin
and curse of slavery, and consecrated it to freedom, as
one of the grandest moral events in the annals of
mankind.</p>

<p>Without that Ordinance, the Declaration of Independence
itself, in its application to that vast and fertile
region, would have been deprived of its power to confer
blessing and prosperity upon it; and it is a fact
never to be forgotten, that the original Declaration and
the original Ordinance were both drawn up by the
same great champion of human rights, whose hatred
of slavery grew strong and deep by his personal
knowledge of its wrongs and its calamities.</p>

<p>Without the Ordinance, the Revolution itself, in its
application to that territory, and the treaty of 1783, by<span class="pagenum" id="Page_339">[Pg 339]</span>
which its ample domain was secured to the Union,
would have been shorn of their glory, and robbed of
their value.</p>

<p>Without the Ordinance, the discovery of this Western
continent, so far as that territory constitutes a part
of it, would have given us no occasion to remember
the name of Columbus with gratitude.</p>

<p>Without the Ordinance, it would have been better,
at the creation of the world, that all that part of it
which now constitutes your five beautiful and flourishing
states, with a residuum of space large enough for still
another, had been left as a “Dead Sea,” whose bitter
and poisonous waters would not have allowed a live
thing to swim beneath its surface, nor to fly above it,
nor a green thing to grow by its shores.</p>

<p>And without the Ordinance, it is no irreverence to
say, that even the omnipotent Spirit of God, working
through natural laws, for human progress and human
blessedness, would have met with bafflings and threatenings
in its operations and influences for the redemption
of the race.</p>

<p>Accept, gentlemen, the assurance of my sympathy
and regard.</p>

for Representative to the Thirty-second Congress.</span></p>


<p class="right">
<span class="smcap">West Newton</span>, Oct. 24, 1850.<br>
</p>

<p>
<span class="smcap">Hon. C. F. Adams</span>;<br>
</p>

<p>Dear Sir,—Your favor of the 21st inst., is this
day received. It informs me that at a convention,
(over which you had the honor to preside,) held at
Dedham, on the 16th inst., I was unanimously nominated
as a candidate for Representative to the thirty-second
Congress of the United States. For the kind
terms in which your communication is expressed, be
pleased to accept my thanks.</p>

<p>This nomination places me in no new relation to the
friends of freedom and humanity, wherever they may
be found. I believe my name was first suggested to
the voters of this district, (now nearly three years ago,)
on the ground of my supposed devotion to the rights of
men. The resolutions passed at all the conventions by
which I have been nominated, and especially those
passed so repeatedly and unanimously by our state
legislature, have been in the nature of instructions; or,
at least, of urgent advice and solicitation, in regard to
my course on the great questions which have since
agitated the country. My own convictions of duty so
fully and entirely corresponding with the injunctions
thus laid upon me, it has been easy for me to act in full
conformity to the wishes of the great majority of my
constituents and of the state, as those wishes have been
repeatedly expressed. This renders any detailed exposition
of expectations on your part, or of assurances on
mine, unnecessary. I know that the leading and most<span class="pagenum" id="Page_341">[Pg 341]</span>
valued article in your creed is the sacredness and security
of human freedom. You know that I embrace
this same article of faith with my whole heart. Other
matters may be very important, but still are subordinate.
Peculiar forms of organization are comparatively
non-essentials. They are but means to ends; and, in
regard to them, a large allowance is to be made for
honest differences of opinion. But the natural right
of every human being to the liberty which God has
given him, until forfeited by crime of his own; the
duty of our government to save every part of this
earth over which it has jurisdiction from the direst of
all earthly curses and the greatest of all social crimes,—the
curse and the crime of slavery;—these are
among the first of the dread accountabilities that attach
to rational and immortal creatures.</p>

<p>I believe it also to be the duty of government to
provide for the economical or pecuniary welfare of the
people; to encourage industry by securing the rewards
of labor to the laborer, and to discourage the competitions
into which those who rule and control the impoverished,
degraded, and almost brutified laborers of
other countries, are striving to enter with our own
people,—competitions, which, if not prevented, will,
to a great extent, reduce our laborers to the wretchedness
and privation of theirs. I believe that the money,
and the comforts purchasable with it, which such competitions
take from the workman here, do not go to
improve the condition of the workman there, but are
intercepted and appropriated by others. I make this
statement of my views all the more readily, because I
do not wish to receive an unintelligent vote from any
man, and I therefore abjure all disguises and reserves.
From my past votes and speeches in Congress my constituents
know upon what principles and to what ends
I have acted. To them I refer, and deem it unnecessary
to say more.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_342">[Pg 342]</span></p>

<p>Those who have taken the trouble to read what I
have said on the floor of the House, must have seen
that, though I have endeavored to express some stern
truths, on vital subjects, in unambiguous language, yet
that I have never uttered a word designed to inflict unnecessary
pain upon our political brethren of the south;
or to wound feelings which men may erroneously call
honorable. I desire to pursue the same course at all
times and with all men. The cause of liberty is one
in which the true object of ambition is to make great
principles most clear, and not to use harsh expressions
respecting the conduct or opinion of others. It is as
necessary that the man whom I would convince should
be in a calm state of mind, as that I should be in such
a state myself. Exasperation paralyzes judgment.
The great points on which men and parties so vehemently
differ, can only be permanently settled at the
tribunal of reason and conscience.</p>

<p>Several laws were passed at the last session of Congress,
on which I desired and designed to speak, in the
name and on behalf of my constituents. But I was
obliged to act upon them, under the silence enforced by
the previous question. One of them, in particular, was
so hostile to all the principles which history and
reason had ever taught me, and so wounding to all the
sentiments which I had ever imbibed from benevolence
and religion, that I resolved to seize the first opportunity
that should be offered to portray some of its
features. I refer to the Fugitive Slave act, so called;
and I trust this will not be deemed an unfitting occasion
to lay bare a portion of its enormities. I will remark,
that I had prepared an amendment for the security
of our free colored seamen in southern ports, but
was shut out from all chance of offering it. It struck
me that if new and oppressive measures were to be
taken to carry back alleged slaves to bondage, something
should also be done to restore freemen to liberty.<span class="pagenum" id="Page_343">[Pg 343]</span>
While the south were seeking new guaranties for men
who claim to own other men, it was a time for the
north to demand new guaranties for men who own
themselves. But all debate was suppressed; property
vanquished liberty; and a pure pro-slavery law was
enacted, unadulterated by any alloy of freedom.</p>

<p>In regard to this Fugitive Slave act, is it not astonishing
that men should ever ask the question, Does the
constitution <i>demand</i> the trial by jury? instead of the
question, Will the constitution <i>allow</i> it? The first is
the tyrant’s question, granting no more than he is compelled
to give. The last is the republican’s question,
volunteering all that he can grant. In a free government,
where the trial by jury is held to be the surest
safeguard of personal liberty, the inquiry ought never
to be, whether the constitution <i>secures or necessitates</i>
this form of trial; for it is enough, if the constitution
will <i>permit</i> or <i>tolerate</i> it. Instead of seeking evasions,
and close constructions, and hunting among the musty
precedents of darker times, in order to shut out the
jury trial in cases of personal liberty, the true lover of
freedom would ask only for an interpretation that would
<i>warrant</i> it. It would not be among his last thoughts;
he would not wait until a stern necessity forced such a
construction upon him; but his first desire and effort
would be to find some legitimate reason for conferring
it. He would not ask, in how few cases he must, but
in how many he might, admit it. Yet this matter has
been discussed, and is still discussed, on one side, as
though we were bound to avoid the jury trial if we
could; not as though we were bound to grant it, if by
fair interpretation we might. It has been discussed as
though the jury trial, to protect a man’s right to himself,
were an evil; and as though the sudden seizure,
“summary” adjudication, and speedy consignment of
a fellow-being to bondage, were too precious a blessing
to be put in jeopardy, by submission to twelve good<span class="pagenum" id="Page_344">[Pg 344]</span>
and lawful men. Not how much may we do for freedom,
but how much can we do for slavery, has been
the tacit assumption of the argument. But I pass by
this for graver objections.</p>

<p>The Fugitive Slave act purports to confer judicial
power upon persons who are not judges. It provides
for the creation of scores and hundreds of officers
called “commissioners,” and upon these, it is said on
high authority, to confer <i>original</i> and <i>final</i> jurisdiction
on questions of human liberty. The constitution
declares in whom “the judicial power of the United
States shall be vested.” It shall be vested in “one
supreme court, and in such inferior courts as Congress
may from time to time establish.” No commissioner,
nor any number of commissioners, constitute one of
these courts. “The judges, both of the supreme and
inferior courts, shall hold their offices during good
behavior.” A commissioner can be made and unmade
on any day. These judges are to “receive for
their services a compensation, which shall not be
diminished during their continuance in office.” The
commissioners are compensated by chance fees, and
not by a fixed salary. The President nominates and
the Senate confirms judges of the supreme and inferior
courts. Commissioners are only the “inferior
officers” who may be appointed by “the courts of
law.”</p>

<p>I need not enforce the position, that the power
which this act purports to confer upon commissioners
is <i>judicial</i>. It has all the attributes of judicial power.
It is <i>original</i>, <i>final</i>, and <i>exclusive</i>. They are “to
hear and <i>determine</i>.” The fourth section says they
“shall have <i>concurrent</i> jurisdiction with the judges
of the circuit and district courts of the United States.”
The attorney-general of the United States, in a written
opinion, given by command of the President of
the United States, says as follows: “These officers,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_345">[Pg 345]</span>
[the commissioners,] and each of them, have <i>judicial</i>
power, and jurisdiction to hear, examine, and decide
the case.” “The certificate to be granted to the
owner is to be regarded as the act and judgment
of a judicial tribunal having competent jurisdiction.”
“Congress has constituted a tribunal with exclusive
jurisdiction to determine summarily, and without appeal,
who are fugitives from service.” “The judgment
of the tribunal created by this act is conclusive
upon all tribunals.” The power of a commissioner,
therefore, is <i>judicial</i> in the highest sense,—in the
sense of the constitution. His decision cannot be
reheard or reëxamined by any judge, or by any court,
of any state, or of the United States. In no other
case can a commissioner perform any judicial act, or
issue any executive order, whose validity may not be
reëxamined in the court for which he acts, or in some
other. He cannot strike a blow, nor fine a dollar, nor
punish by imprisonment for an hour. By appeal, by
injunction, by mandamus or certiorari, the proceedings
of inferior courts or magistrates can be reached, and
their legality or constitutionality tested. But here a
multitude of tribunals are established, over whose proceedings,
not the supreme court of any state, no, not
even the supreme court of the United States, has
supervision. And what do these commissioners decide?
That a man has no right to himself; that his body,
limbs, faculties, are the <i>property</i> of another; that he
<i>owes service</i>. Suppose the question were, whether the
respondent owed the claimant a dollar. Could the
commissioner give judgment and issue execution for
it? Certainly not. But yet he is here authorized to
decide questions infinitely more important than any
amount of money. He is to decide that a man owes
life-long service from himself, and from all the children
of his loins.</p>

<p>But the surrender of an alleged fugitive from service<span class="pagenum" id="Page_346">[Pg 346]</span>
has been compared with the surrender of a fugitive
from justice; and because the supreme executive of a
state is required by the law of 1793 to surrender fugitives
from justice, it is claimed that any commissioner
may surrender fugitives from service, <i>without liability
to question or reëxamination by any human authority</i>.
But there is a world-wide difference between the cases.
When the fugitive from justice is delivered up, he is
delivered into the custody of the law. Legal process
must have been commenced against him in the state
from which he fled. He is returned, that the proceedings
thus commenced may be consummated. He is
never intrusted to private hands. The shield of the
law is continued over him. After arrest, he is merely
transferred from the hands of the law in one state to
the hands of the law in another state. He is transferred,
not to evade trial, but to have one. But the
alleged slave is delivered up, not into the custody of
the law, where his rights might be adjudicated upon,
but into private hands; not into the hands of a neutral
or indifferent person, but into the hands of a party
interested to deprive him of all his rights;—if he be
not a slave, then into the hands of a man-stealer. Mr.
Clay saw this, and his plan provided that the alleged
fugitive should be sent home <i>to be tried</i>. But the
south grew bolder and bolder, until a law was passed,
by which one class of men have less security for their
freedom than another class have for their cattle.</p>

<p>It is nugatory to say, that when an alleged fugitive
has reached his claimant’s domicile, he may there petition
for freedom. Should he do so, it would be an
independent and original proceeding, instituted under
<i>another</i> government. Not only would the jurisdiction
be different, but the character of the litigants would
be changed,—plaintiff for defendant, and defendant for
plaintiff. The old case is not to be reheard, but a new
one tried. Indeed, a very intelligent writer on this<span class="pagenum" id="Page_347">[Pg 347]</span>
subject has queried whether the certificate of the
commissioner may not be pleaded as an estoppel. I
say, then, that, in effect, the commissioner, by this
act, has <i>original</i>, <i>final</i>, and <i>exclusive</i> jurisdiction of a
“case” “in law,” “arising under the constitution and
laws of the United States.” This is the very function
of judges and courts. This is the identical
power which the constitution of the United States
vests in judges who are to be nominated by the President,
confirmed by the Senate, to hold office during
good behavior, and to be compensated by fixed salaries.</p>

<p>Again, the act consigns a man to bondage, without
crime, on evidence which he has had no opportunity
to controvert. The claimant must prove three facts
before the commissioner,—1st, That the person named
in the warrant owes the claimant service; 2d, That
he has escaped; 3d, Identity.</p>

<p>Now, according to the act, the first two points,—the
facts of owing service and of escaping,—may be
proved behind the respondent’s back. This proof
may be procured against the alleged fugitive without
any notice to him, actual or constructive; without the
possibility of his encountering it, or disproving it,
however false it may be. If this be not depriving a
person of his “liberty” “without due process of law,”
what can be? Why not make the whole case provable
behind the man’s back,—in another state,—a
thousand miles off,—and spurn the forms of justice,
after having spurned its substance? This binding of
a man by evidence obtained without his knowledge,
is unknown to the common law, and abhorrent to it.
It is never permitted, not even to deprive the worst
man of the humblest right. Our laws save the rights
of all parties under disability. Who is under so great
a disability as he who knows nothing, and can know
nothing, of what is going on against him? Notwithstanding
the constitution declares that “full faith and<span class="pagenum" id="Page_348">[Pg 348]</span>
credit shall be given in each state to the public acts,
records, and judicial proceedings of every other state,”
yet it has been held that a judgment obtained in
another state, without notice, shall not prejudice the
party against whom it was rendered. Such an act violates
the first principles of justice. All securities for
the life, liberty and property of us all, are swept away
if such principles can be established.</p>

<p>Once more: The act says the certificate “shall be
conclusive of the right of the person or persons in
whose favor granted, to remove such fugitive to the
state or territory from which he escaped, and shall prevent
all molestation of such person or persons, by any
process issued by any court, judge, magistrate, or any
other person whomsoever.” According to this, the
certificate is a talisman which protects its holder
against all law, all evidence, and all judicial power. A
kidnapper may seize a free man in Boston, buy evidence
that he owes this mysterious <i>debt of service</i>, obtain the
requisite certificate against his victim, and then neither
the mother who bore him, nor the elder brothers and
sisters who grew up with him, nor the neighbors who
have known him from his cradle, nor the minister who
baptized him, can testify that he is free; nor can all
the judges and courts in the commonwealth stop the
man who is bearing away one of their fellow-citizens
to a bondage worse than death, to inquire into his title.
He is in a charmed circle that neither law nor justice
can enter. Do you ask where is that old, time-honored
writ of <i>habeas corpus</i>, for which martyrs have died and
rivers of blood have flowed, and which the constitution
declares <span class="allsmcap">SHALL NOT</span> be suspended “unless when in
cases of rebellion or invasion, the public safety may
require it”? The answer is, that the writ of <i>habeas
corpus</i> is nothing but a “process issued” by a court,
and the act declares that the holder of the certificate
shall be exempt from all “molestation,” “by any process<span class="pagenum" id="Page_349">[Pg 349]</span>
issued by any court.” In one word, the law contains
a provision that its own constitutionality shall not
be brought into question; at least, until its victim
reaches the place of his bondage, and is beyond the
reach of rescuing hands.</p>

<p>Now, even if this act does not commit such gross
infractions of the constitution that the courts will set
it aside, yet it would seem as though no sane man
could help seeing that it wars upon all our ideas of
justice; that it repudiates and scorns all the great securities
for freedom which wise and good men, for
centuries past, have given their labors, and their lives,
to establish; and that it converts the vast machinery
of the social state, not into the means of protecting,
but of assailing, the liberties of the citizen. As to the
appointment of commissioners, it gives us none of the
constitutional securities that improper men will not
be invested with these high prerogatives against our
dearest rights; and as to the manner in which evidence
may be procured, it resembles the missives which the
inquisition, in olden times, sent forth against heretics,
to seize without law, to try without defence, and to
punish without mercy or hope. It resembles the
<i>lettres de cachet</i>, which, before the great revolution, the
despots of France gave, <i>in blank</i>, to villain courtiers,
and villain courtesans, to be filled up with the names
of those persons whose perdition they would compass.</p>

<p>There are other points in this bill whose enormity
only needs to be stated to be seen and abhorred. One
of them is so unspeakably mean and contemptible,
that all northern men must feel the insult more keenly
than the wrong. It provides that if a commissioner
will doom a man to bondage, his fee shall be twice as
much as though he restores him to liberty. Now,
every body knows that claimants will rarely, if ever,
appear before commissioners without a <i>prima facie</i>
case. If there be no defence, the proceedings will be<span class="pagenum" id="Page_350">[Pg 350]</span>
brief. But a case of discharge presupposes a defence
and a trial. A case of discharge, therefore, will probably
occupy as much time as half a dozen cases of
surrender. Yet for this greater labor, the commissioner
is to have but half price. In assailing all we
love of liberty, could not the framers and supporters of
this measure have forborne to wound us in all we feel
of honor!</p>

<p>The cases are to be “heard and determined,” as
they were under Robespierre, “<i>in a summary manner</i>.”
Shakspeareenumerates the “law’s delay”
among the causes of suicide. Under this act, real
suicides will doubtless be occasioned by the <i>law’s
despatch</i>.<a id="FNanchor_15" href="#Footnote_15" class="fnanchor">[15]</a> This “summary manner” contains the
sum of wrong. Does not every lawyer and every
client know that when an action is brought for the
unfaithful execution of a contract, in building a house
or a ship, or for the balance of an account, or for flowing
lands, or for defamation or libel, the defendant
needs weeks and often months to make ready for his
defence. His witnesses may be in another state, or
abroad; it may be necessary to examine ancient titles
in registries of deeds or of wills, to make surveys of
premises, or investigations into character and conduct.
It often happens that when process is first served upon
a man, he does not know the grounds of his own defence.
They may consist of facts which he has forgotten,
or of law of which he is ignorant. Our courts,
acting upon this well-known truth, have established a
rule that a party, even after he has had fourteen days’
notice, shall be entitled to a continuance as a matter
of right, unless under special circumstances; and he
may always have it on cause shown. I ask any defendant
who was ever forced into court to resist a<span class="pagenum" id="Page_351">[Pg 351]</span>
claim of any magnitude or difficulty, whether he was
ready to do so, on the instant when process was served
upon him? Yet this is what the respondent must do
under the Fugitive Slave act. On the 26th day of last
September, James Hamlet was peacefully pursuing a
lawful occupation in Water Street, New York, and
earning an honest support for his wife and children.
In three hours, hand-cuffed, in irons, and surrounded by
armed men, he was on his way to the house of bondage.
No time was given him for procuring the aid of counsel.
He declared he was free, that his mother was a
free woman, and he a free man. But by another provision
in the act, it is declared that “in no trial or
hearing under this act, shall the testimony of such alleged
fugitive be admitted in evidence.” In all other
cases, within the broad compass of the common or
statute law of Great Britain or of this country, a party
litigant may give evidence pertaining to the suit. In
some cases, he may give evidence on the merits; in
all cases, he may make affidavit on interlocutory matters.
A man who has been in the state prison, a felon
scarred with crime, may still make affidavit, in his own
case, under certain circumstances, though he can testify
neither for nor against any other person. But an alleged
fugitive can make oath to no fact, and under no circumstances,
for delay or other cause. It would conflict
with that “summary manner” in which it is
deemed expedient to dispose of human liberty.</p>

<p>Look at this provision under the light of a few
facts. In the case of <i>Mahoney</i> vs. <i>Ashton</i>, (4 Harris
&amp; McHenry’s Maryland Reports,) the petitioner for
freedom claimed that a maternal ancestor, <i>four generations
back</i>, who had been brought over by Lord Baltimore,
in the early days of the colony, was free; and,
by an extraordinary chain of evidence, he traced his
descent from that free source. It was a claim which
any court in Massachusetts would have sustained
without hesitation.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_352">[Pg 352]</span></p>

<p>Now how much evidence of history, of record, of
parol, does the bare mention of such a case suggest?
Who could have been prepared to try it in three hours;
ay, as soon as he could be seized and hurried to a
lawyer’s office?</p>

<p>Among the alleged fugitives in the “Pearl cases,”
so called, which I assisted in trying in Washington,
in the years 1848 and ’49, was the family of Daniel
Bell, consisting of his wife and eight or ten children.
The mother and children had been freed many
years before by deed of manumission, executed by
their master in his last sickness, and they had been
reputed free ever afterwards. Soon after the grantor’s
death, the device was started of proving him to be of
“unsound mind,” and thus reclaiming the family to
bondage. But the magistrate who prepared the deed,
witnessed its execution, and took the acknowledgment,
declared that he stood ready to testify to the <i>competency</i>
of the grantor, and the validity of the instrument.
Years passed away and <i>he</i> died. Immediately
the heirs claimed the family as slaves; and, after the
loss of the deceased magistrate’s testimony, proved the
grantor of “unsound mind,” and so set aside the deed
and were adjudged owners of the <i>chattels</i>. On the
ground of newly-discovered evidence, application for a
new trial was made; but the family becoming alarmed
lest they should be secretly seized and sent to the
south, attempted to make their escape on board the
“Pearl,” on the night of the 15th of April. Now, suppose
that they had succeeded, and that, after arriving
in a free state, they had been seized and carried before
a commissioner, to be tried in this “summary manner,”
without even waiting for a crier to open the court, and
debarred from making affidavit that, in the city of
Washington, there existed evidence of their freedom.
I will not waste words to point out the impossibility
of their defence, and the certainty of their doom! He<span class="pagenum" id="Page_353">[Pg 353]</span>
that hath ears to hear the cry of the oppressed, let him
hear!</p>

<p>A few days before the close of the last session of
Congress, I was inquired of by a resident in Washington,
as to the condition of a family held as slaves in
that city. I found they were free by the laws of the
District, but they did not know it.</p>

<p>Sir, throughout the Southern States, there are thousands
and thousands of reputed slaves, who, legally,
and by the laws of those states, too, in which they are
held, are as free as the governor of Massachusetts, or
the chief justice; but, in their enforced and brutish ignorance,
the victims do not know it; and should they
come to a free state, and be there hunted, and seized,
and carried before a commissioner, they would be debarred
from taking an oath as to facts which would
furnish grounds for a continuance so that their right
to freedom might be established. But, under such obstructions
and embarrassments, liberty could not be
extinguished in a sufficiently “summary manner.”</p>

<p>According to the constitution of the United States,
all <i>criminals</i>, from the least to the greatest, are to be
informed of the nature and cause of their accusation;
to be confronted with the witnesses against them; to
have compulsory process for obtaining witnesses in
their favor; and to have the assistance of counsel in
their defence. Yet here, always in the case of an
<i>innocent</i> man, oftentimes in the case of a free man, there
is to be no previous notice, no process for obtaining
witnesses, and no provision for counsel; and while the
court is forbidden to allow delay, without good cause
shown, the party whose liberty is at stake cannot make
out that cause by his oath; but, with the full knowledge
in his own breast that he <i>is</i> free, he must stand
dumb before the minister of the law that puts on his
fetters.</p>

<p>I will not dwell at any length upon those portions<span class="pagenum" id="Page_354">[Pg 354]</span>
of the act which affect marshals and deputy marshals.
If any man chooses not to hold office under such a
law, he can decline to accept it, or resign it. It is,
however, clear proof of wicked legislation, when humane
and conscientious men cannot hold the offices it
creates. But the fifth section contains a provision
which is atrocious. It makes the marshal or his deputy
liable for an escape, whether made “with or <i>without</i>
his assent,”—that is, <i>at all events</i>. Though the
alleged fugitive should disable him, though the enemies
of the country should capture him, though the act of
God should strike him down, though an armed mob
should commit a rescue,—yet he is still liable.</p>

<p>All civilized governments have statutes of limitations.
Human welfare requires that claims which have
long been voluntarily acquiesced in, should not be revived.
Hence our laws bar a right of action, otherwise
incontrovertible, after that tacit abandonment of
which the mere lapse of time is proof. Personal rights
are most generally abandoned by a six years’ neglect
to enforce them. Even real estate may be held, by
twenty years’ quiet possession, without other title.
Crimes partake of this exemption. With the single
exception of murder, all crimes are barred in Massachusetts
by a six years’ delay to prosecute. But the
Fugitive Slave act knows no mercy or compassion of
this kind. Unrelentingly it fastens its clutch upon all
cases. While life lasts, its fangs strike into the flesh.
The alleged slave may have been amongst us for fifty
years; he may have earned property, be married, and
surrounded by children. It is all the same. The inexorable
certificate of a commissioner remands him to
bondage and despair.</p>

<p>The act not only remands him to bondage, but,
under circumstances to which there will be few exceptions,
it orders that he be sent home at the public
expense. The constitution says, he shall be “delivered<span class="pagenum" id="Page_355">[Pg 355]</span>
up.” There the obligation of that instrument ceases.
It is only the law that adds, he shall be <i>carried
back</i>. You and I, sir, must help pay the costs of
sending a fellow-being into bondage; when we are
under no more constitutional obligation to do so, than
to pay the expenses of a slave dealer who ships his
cargoes direct from Africa.</p>

<p>But the bill has become a law, and the practical
question now is, how can the country be exculpated
from the crime, and the dishonor. For myself, I do
not adopt the doctrine of forcible nullification. I trust
I shall never join a mob to resist a law, until I am
ready for revolution. The only true and enduring
remedy is repeal. Those who would forcibly resist
the law, lose half their motive and impulse for repeal;
for if we abolish it without repealing it, it will be
likely to remain upon the statute book an eternal monument
of the nation’s disgrace. Let effort never cease,
until the jury trial be obtained.</p>

<p>But this view of civil duty applies only to the <i>citizen</i>.
It does not touch the fugitive. One liberty the
slave always has,—whenever he deems it expedient,
he may re-clothe himself in the rights which God and
nature gave him, and which, though they may be
ravished from him, can never be destroyed.</p>

<p>Until repeal, however, there is one opening for hope.
If, as is said by Mr. Crittenden, in the opinion already
cited, “Congress has constituted a tribunal with <i>exclusive</i>
jurisdiction, to determine summarily, and without
appeal;” and if, as he further says, “the judgment of
every tribunal of exclusive jurisdiction, where no appeal
lies, is of necessity <i>conclusive upon every other
tribunal</i>, <span class="allsmcap">AND THEREFORE THE JUDGMENT OF THE
TRIBUNAL CREATED BY THIS ACT IS CONCLUSIVE UPON
ALL TRIBUNALS</span>;” then the whole case in all its bearings
and relations, its sources and its issues, comes before
the commissioner; not even the supreme court of the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_356">[Pg 356]</span>
United States can interfere with him; and the first
question for him to “hear and determine” is, whether
in truth there be any such <i>law</i>, whether the whole
disgraceful enactment be not unconstitutional and void;
and, therefore, whether his first and only duty be not
to dismiss the proceedings, and to “let the captive go
free.” I am not without hope that such will be the
result; and thus, that many conscientious and law-abiding
men will be relieved from the moral anxiety
and conflict which now oppresses their minds.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Gentlemen and Fellow-Citizens</span>;</p>

<p>Having been specially invited to appear before this
meeting, and address it, my friend Mr. Russell has
introduced me to you with many kind words; and he
has emphatically announced me as “your old friend.”
By so doing, gentlemen, he has touched a living chord
in my heart; for, as I look around me, I see many
familiar and dear faces, and am reminded that, in this
town, I spent some of the happiest years of my life.
The sight of every object around me awakens remembrances
of home. Right opposite to us is the court
house, in whose forum my feeble voice was first
raised, and where, I thank God, it was never raised in
behalf of the oppressor, nor on the side of any cause
which I believed to be wrong. Around this church
in which we are assembled are the streets where I
used to walk, there is the pew where I used to sit, and
all around me are persons whom, for years, I saw daily
and knew intimately, and knew them only to respect.
I feel assured that I do meet “old friends,”—true
men, who carry their hearts in their hands, and whose
lives are anchored to their convictions of duty.</p>

<p>Gentlemen, it is not without embarrassment that I
address you. Yet I might plead a high example for
my course, if I were worthy, in any respect, to mention
myself in connection with my venerated predecessor,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_358">[Pg 358]</span>
who has made the past history of his country so luminous
with his wisdom and purity, and the name of
this district which he represented so honored and
memorable. Would to God I could carry you to some
Pisgah height, and show you, under one view, the
past, the present, and the future, as he was wont to
do, when, as was his custom, he used to address you
on those great topics which employed his energies,—on
the principles by which you ought to be guided,
and on the dangers to which you were exposed.</p>

<p>We have fallen, gentleman, on momentous times.
Great events have occurred, in rapid succession, both
in this and in the other hemisphere. There seems to
have been a grand upheaving of the elements of society
from its deep foundations. We have been so often
astonished and amazed, by shock after shock, and convulsion
after convulsion, that I fear we are beginning
to lose our moral sensibility to political catastrophes,
however grand or fatal they may be.</p>

<p>You know there is a spot near the Mississippi River
famous for the frequency of its earthquakes. A gentleman
who visited there some years ago, told me that
soon after entering a hotel, at a place called New
Madrid, his attention was suddenly arrested by the
rattling of the crockery, the jarring of the household
furniture, and the shaking of the chair in which he
sat. Starting up in trepidation, he sprang for the
door. “O,” said his landlord, “don’t be alarmed. <i>It
is nothing but an earthquake.</i>” These phenomena,
it seems, had become so common as to have lost their
power of exciting alarm. So, I fear, it is in regard
to the late commotions in Europe; and especially in
regard to some of the marvellous doings of Congress
in our own country. From their astounding character,
and their rapid succession, I fear we are becoming
insensible to their importance, like the inhabitants
who dwell at the base of Mount Etna, whom neither<span class="pagenum" id="Page_359">[Pg 359]</span>
the rumbling of the mountain, nor the lava rivers
which pour down its side, can awake from their stupor,
until, like Pompeii or Herculaneum, they are
buried in the ruins.</p>

<p>In the old world, things seem already to be settling
back into their former condition, and hopes are darkening
into fears. In this country, I still trust that we
shall redeem something of the past, and secure the
future. Yet the events of the last few months are
of a disheartening character, if any thing could ever
dishearten a true lover of his country. It has been
my fortune and duty to be in the midst of these
events. I have watched the tide of battle with sleepless
eye; and when Liberty at last was stricken down,
my heart bled with hers.</p>

<p>I believe I understand, gentlemen, what you wish
me to do on this occasion; and therefore I shall endeavor
to lay before you, briefly but impartially, the
humble part which I, as your representative, have
taken in those events which have filled the hearts of
good men with alarm.</p>

<p>I would, however, premise a few words, in order to
show how we have come, step by step, to the fearful
position we now occupy.</p>

<p>Very early in our history, as a republic established
to maintain the rights of man, an extent of territory
was acquired equal to all we possessed before; and this
addition accrued to the special advantage of those who
maintain, as the first great article in their creed, the
wrongs of man. The same European wars which
enabled Mr. Jefferson’s administration to purchase
Louisiana with fifteen millions of dollars,—a sum
mostly paid by the north,—brought the commercial
interests of the north also within the destructive sweep
of those contests, and the non-intercourse act and the
embargo were the consequence. These came upon
New England at a time when commerce was her only<span class="pagenum" id="Page_360">[Pg 360]</span>
resource. They brought as great a calamity upon the
New England states as it would now be to the south
if their whole cotton crop, or to the west if their
whole grain crop, were to fail for a series of years.
They palsied our industry; and, without industry,
men, any where out of Paradise, will be poor. Upon
the back of this calamity came the war of 1812,
which we bore as well as we could, and performed our
full share in carrying the country through it, though
it cut off our very means of living. That war revealed
a lamentable condition of things. It revealed
the fact that, notwithstanding our political independence,
we were, in a commercial sense, most deplorably
dependent. It pointed to a new policy. It put the
country upon achieving its second independence,—its
independence, at least for the necessaries of life, of
foreign mechanics, manufacturers, and artisans, as it
had already achieved its political independence of foreign
kings, aristocracies, and ecclesiastics. It gave
birth to the American system, in which Calhoun,
Lowndes, Cheves, and Clay,—all from the slave
states,—took the lead. I mention the first three
names, particularly, because they were from the state
of South Carolina. So heartily did they enter into
the new policy that they took their seats in Congress
clad in homespun. They said they would exemplify
their principles by their garments, and wear them outside
as well as inside of their bodies. I am sorry
their principles lasted but little longer than their
clothes,—one suit worn out, and all, both without
and within, clean gone. Even Mr. Madison boasted
that his coat was woven in an American loom. The
south led off in this policy, and New England, whose
capital had been wrecked on the ocean, was reluctantly
compelled to follow their lead. This was the origin
of the protective tariff, the child of South Carolina,
though, at a later period, adopted by Massachusetts.<span class="pagenum" id="Page_361">[Pg 361]</span>
It was not, however, until 1824, that New England,
and Massachusetts particularly, gave in her adhesion
to the protective policy. Then our people engaged
in manufactures. The streams were dammed, and
the mighty powers of nature were set to spinning
and weaving, to dyeing and printing, under the guidance
of that genius which had been kindled and nurtured
in our schoolhouses. Those establishments were
founded which have produced so marvellous a change
in our household condition, surrounding all with so
many comforts, and filling our dwellings with so vast
a variety of the refinements and luxuries of life.
Those of you who have arrived at my age, and are
therefore acquainted with the condition of things
throughout our country towns thirty years ago, know
that the change is almost magical. Though opposed
in its inception by the cities and the merchants, yet it
has promoted their prosperity not less than that of
the people.</p>

<p>In the year 1820, a national question of a great
moral character arose. The south, whose policy had
before secured a territory as large as that of the original
thirteen, sought to extend slavery over its whole surface.
Missouri applied to be admitted into the Union as
a slave state. The morality and religion of the north
thought the time had come to arrest the strides of
slavery, and they opposed the application. Earnest
resistance was made. The battle was obstinately
fought; but at last, the north, or rather enough recreants
of the north yielded, and the day was lost. The
south bought or bullied a sufficient number of the
invertebrate creatures whom we send to Congress, and
triumphed over us. This was the first great surrender
of principle on the part of the north, and a fatal surrender
it was. We, and humanity, and all that is
dearest to the heart and thoughts of man, might have
achieved the victory but for a few cases of foul<span class="pagenum" id="Page_362">[Pg 362]</span>
treachery to the cause of freedom. O, that the retributions
for that treason had been so terrible, that the
coward motive of fear, if not the angel impulse of humanity,
might have deterred all men in after times
from ever daring to repeat it.</p>

<p>The next great struggle was in 1833, when nullification
first reared its hideous head. At that epoch,
the south, and especially South Carolina, observing
that our capital had been too deeply invested in manufactures
to be withdrawn, changed their policy, and
sought to reap a double harvest,—both of the manufacturing
system they had introduced, and of the free
trade system they had abandoned. She therefore set
about to strangle that offspring of protection to which
she had given birth. Even in Virginia, Mr. Madison’s
coat had become an unconstitutional coat, and the idea
of American woollens so wrought upon Mr. John
Randolph’s gentle affections, that he said he would go
a mile out of his way to kick a sheep. The South
Carolina resistance was beginning to assume a military
form. Then occurred a most admirable opportunity
to test the strength of our government,—to learn and
know whether the pillars of this Union are made of
granite or of pipe-stems. We had a clear case of right.
In the chair of state was a man of Roman will, who
would have rejoiced in the opportunity to <i>see that the
republic received no detriment.</i> He contemned the
nonsense as much as he despised the fraud, of the cry
that the Union was in danger. If it was in any danger,
he would have saved it in such a way that it
would not need saving again every twelvemonth. But
the chance was lost. A compromise was brought forward,
by which South Carolina consented to a sort of
armed truce, on her part, provided the tariff, though
not given up, should be tapered down almost to nothing.
Though, on many accounts, I have a high respect for
the author of that compromise, yet I regard it as the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_363">[Pg 363]</span>
most unfortunate act ever done,—the most fatal precedent
ever set by this government. It taught the
south the efficacy of clamoring; it taught them that
there are cases where a Bombastes Furioso is as powerful
as a Julius Cæsar; and it taught them also, notwithstanding
all appearances of solidity and firmness,
of what a delicate nervous tissue a money-bag consists.</p>

<p>When that compromise law had had time to reach
its legitimate issues, you all know the result. A whirlwind
of bankruptcy swept over the land. Its ravages
reached even the humblest portions of society. The
laborer suffered even more than the capitalist. The
latter suffered in his gains, but the former in his bread.
All classes perceived the cause; and they rallied, almost
as one man, to that tremendous effort to change
the policy of the country, which resulted in the election
to the presidency of General Harrison. Though,
but a few days after his inauguration, the reins of government
fell from his lifeless hands, yet the tariff of
1842 was the consequence of his election. This restored
the drooping fortunes of New England. Then
it was, while we were immersed in our business and
our money making, that southern politicians addressed
themselves to that great scheme of pro-slavery aggrandizement,—the
annexation of Texas. You are all
familiar with the details of this transaction, and it is
painful to revert to them. The kid was seethed in its
mother’s milk. Northern Democrats cast the votes
which gave Texas to the south, and destroyed our own
prosperity. Texas was admitted just in season to repeal,
by her votes in the Senate, the tariff of 1842, by
that of 1846. This again put in jeopardy all our
means embarked in manufactures. Would to Heaven
that nothing more dear than pecuniary interests had
been sacrificed by that measure.</p>

<p>I do not blame the south for seeking an equilibrium
with the north; but they do not seek the true equilibrium.<span class="pagenum" id="Page_364">[Pg 364]</span>
If they would sustain themselves in a competition
with us in economical affairs, they must encourage
labor and render it honorable. They must,
all of them, labor as we do, in one way or another,
with the hand or with the head; or,—which is the
only true way,—with both together. They must
build schoolhouses to develop the minds of their children,
and churches to cultivate their morals. If they
would only do this, and not attempt to carry every
thing by slave-begotten votes, and by adding new
states to beget more slave votes, they would soon surpass
us; for nature has done vastly more for them, in
soil and climate and in all the means of earthly prosperity,
than for us. A superiority obtained in this
way, we, as lovers of human happiness, should not
repine at, but rejoice in.</p>

<p>The next struggle in which they engaged for political
aggrandizement, was the Mexican war. It could,
indeed, hardly be called a struggle,—the north so
readily and ignominiously yielded. They wanted
more territory. Texas, already gravid with future
slave states, was not sufficient. And though it was
yet somewhat uncertain whether Congress would
not interdict the extension of slavery over that country,
even should they conquer it; still, as they had
always triumphed in their contests with us, they assumed
the risk, and trusted to their future prowess and
skill to monopolize the plunder. The territory was
conquered; and then, perhaps, the most important question
arose which has ever come before this country
since the Declaration of Independence. The most
momentous consequences were suspended on the decision
of this question. We had, as it were, a creative
power put into our hands. We had the shaping of the
destinies of half a continent intrusted to our keeping.
Our authority once exercised, the act would be irrevocable,
and the doom of all that region would be fixed,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_365">[Pg 365]</span>
as by a decree of Omnipotence. When God gives to
the world a generation of children, and they are ruined
through parental neglect, he gives another generation,
that another trial may be made. But if we once admit
slavery into those immense regions, comprising all the
unsettled residue of this continent, God will give us no
new continent on which the error may be retrieved.</p>

<p>Now, on this great question, what has been done?
I grieve to say that I fear the battle has been lost. If
not lost, nothing can save it but a vigor and an energy
on the part of the north, such as they have not lately
put forth. So far as legislation is concerned, the
whole battle field is in possession of the enemy. Let
me read a passage from one of the acts of the last session
of Congress, which settles this fact. By the law
for creating the territorial government of New Mexico,
it is expressly provided,—</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>“That when admitted as a state, the said territory, or any
portion of the same, shall be received into the Union, <span class="allsmcap">WITH
OR WITHOUT SLAVERY</span>, as their constitution may prescribe at
the time of their admission.”</p>
</div>

<p>The act providing a territorial government for Utah
contains a provision precisely similar. In regard to
Texas, we have gratuitously given her a right to form
one more slave state than she was authorized to do by
the resolution of annexation. By the third article of
the second section of that resolution, Texas was authorized
to form new states, not exceeding <i>four</i>, of
which those south of 36° 30´ should be admitted, with
or without slavery, as their people should elect, while
in the state or <i>states</i>, (and there must, therefore, be at
least one,) which should be formed north of 36° 30´,
there should be no slavery or involuntary servitude
except for crime. But by the act of the last session,
for establishing the boundary of Texas, though the
United States buys up the claim of Texas to all the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_366">[Pg 366]</span>
territory north of 36° 30´, yet it authorizes Texas to
form as many slave states out of the residue of her territory,
as she could have formed by the resolution of
annexation, both of slave and free. This is manifest,
by the following provision:—</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>“Provided, that nothing herein contained shall be construed
to impair or qualify any thing contained in the third article
of the second section of the joint resolution for annexing Texas
to the United States, approved March 1, 1845, <i>either as regards
the number of states that may hereafter be formed out
of the State of Texas, or otherwise</i>.”</p>
</div>

<p>Here, then, instead of three states, four are provided
for, with full consent that they shall all be slave states.
Now, I ask, if this gift of a slave state is a trifle to be
thrown in like the value of a small coin in the settlement
of an account? In some of the pro-slavery papers
of the north, which have professed to publish this
act for the information of their readers, I have observed
that this clause has been left out! They did not dare
to trust their readers during the present political campaign
with a knowledge of it.</p>

<p>I know it is said, by here and there an individual,
that slavery cannot go into those territories. But it is
to be remembered that all the south, almost as one
man, dissent from this proposition. They say it can
and shall; and is not their opinion, on such a subject,
of greater weight than that of any northern man?
They threaten to dissolve the Union if slavery be prohibited
from going there. Are they such lunatics as to
dissolve the Union, because we assume to prohibit what
nature has already made impossible? Slave states border
on those territories, and should there be any rush
of emigration towards them, as, by the discovery of
mines or other causes there may be, a cloud of slaves
would immediately overspread them. If it be said
that the local law of the territories prohibits slavery, I
reply, so it did in Texas. Slavery had been abolished<span class="pagenum" id="Page_367">[Pg 367]</span>
throughout Mexico, of which Texas was a province.
But though slavery was no longer legal there, peonage
was. Hence the southern planters, at least some of them,
when about to remove to Texas, indented their own
slaves to themselves, as peons, so that they might hold
them by the Mexican law of peonage, until they
should become strong enough to pass a law for slavery.
It will be no more difficult to introduce slavery into
New Mexico and Utah than it was into Texas.</p>

<p>I will not now go back to the questions which agitated
the country and the Whig party at the time when
General Taylor was nominated for the presidency.
Whatever I may have thought of him, and of the propriety
of nominating him, it is but justice to say that I
now believe that he was a true man, and an anti-slavery
man. He intended honestly to carry out the will of
Congress, and execute the laws of his country, regardless
of slaveholding dictation. He would have crushed
the first movement for disunion; or rather, a knowledge
of what he would do, would have prevented any
such movement. With his own lips, in his own house,
he told me that in case any state should attempt to
nullify an act of Congress, he should immediately
order a naval force to blockade its coast; he would allow
nothing to pass into, or to come out of, the rebellious
state; and in six months, said he, it would give
up its resistance without the shedding of blood. It
was President Taylor’s plan, as you well know, to leave
the adjustment of the slavery question to the territories
themselves; not that he was not prepared to have
it settled by Congress, and a prohibition imposed, but
because he saw that while a prohibitory act might be
passed by the House, it would certainly be rejected by
the Senate. He therefore threw himself forward to
what he knew the condition of things must be, after
all the ineffectual attempts at legislation on the subject
had been made; and he adopted that future condition<span class="pagenum" id="Page_368">[Pg 368]</span>
and result of things as his present plan of action.
Should the northern members of the House prove true
to their constituencies and their pledges, they would
never allow the territories to be organized without the
proviso; and the fear of such a prohibition would exclude
slavery from the territories, as certainly as the
prohibition itself. Slaveholders would not venture
to carry slaves into a country, where, at any moment
an act of Congress might emancipate them. And if
slavery could only be kept out of the territories while
they remained territories, it would, of course, be prohibited
by the state itself, when the condition of territorial
pupilage should be succeeded by that of state
independence. A boy trained up to virtuous resolves
until the day he is twenty-one, will not adopt all the
vices the day after.</p>

<p>The recent act has given Texas more than fifty
thousand square miles of free New Mexican territory,
and the promise of ten millions of dollars in fourteen
years, with interest at five per cent. up to that time;
which, at compound interest, makes a prospective grant
of twenty millions of dollars. This is done on pretence
of discharging debts which she owed at the
time of her annexation. But those debts, at the highest
estimate, do not exceed seven millions, so that
a clear gratuity is left to her of at least three millions
in addition to the grant of another slave state. The
interest of these three millions will support her government,
and keep her supplied with the means of fighting
the battles of slavery.</p>

<p>There is something most extraordinary in the claim
of Texas to the territory for which she has obtained
so extravagant a price. Her title was not by conquest,
nor by purchase, but by an act of her own legislature.
She claimed the territory merely because she had extended
her legislation over it, when she had no more
right to legislate for it than for Canada. I have<span class="pagenum" id="Page_369">[Pg 369]</span>
brought with me for your inspection, if any of you
desire to see them, a series of maps which illustrate
the growth of Texas. By Humboldt’s map, of 1804,
Texas contained 71,752 square miles. By Tanner’s
map, of 1826, it contained 108,097 square miles. By
Austin’s map, of 1839, it had grown to 179,567 square
miles. The late claim of its legislature was the enormous
quantity of 325,000 square miles, which the act
of Congress cuts down only to 237,321! By its own
legislative assumptions it grew from 70,000 to 325,000
square miles. By good husbandry, in this part of the
country, we are able to make greater crops grow on the
same land, but in Texas they make the land itself
grow. I think Humboldt himself would have been
astonished at any such geological theory of the uprising
of the earth as would enlarge an area of 70,000
square miles, in an inland country, into more than
300,000, in less than fifty years.</p>

<p>But, fellow-citizens, slavery is already in the territories,
whether prohibited by God and nature, or not!
The line of 36° 30´ crosses the territory appropriated
to the Indians, which is already full of slaves. Whenever
the Indian title is extinguished, slavery will be
found there in possession of the soil. Utah has slaves
to-day, and I was informed by a gentleman chosen as
a delegate from that territory to Congress, that the
Mormon religion prescribes nothing on the subject.</p>

<p>I need not now dwell on another act of the last
session,—the Fugitive Slave Law,—because, as yet,
I believe no voice in Massachusetts has been raised in
its defence or palliation. It is an act which might turn
all of us here, at this moment, into slave hunters;
which might break up this meeting at the present time,
should an officer, clothed with the authority of the
United States, appear at that door and command us
to chase an alleged fugitive, perhaps a native-born
freeman, over the graves of our Pilgrim fathers.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_370">[Pg 370]</span></p>

<p>Standing here, then, before you, my constituents, to
give account of my stewardship, I have to say, that
with voice and vote, by expostulation and by remonstrance,
by all means in my power, I have, to the full
extent of my ability, resisted the passage of all these
laws. Why have I done so? Because, in the first
place, I felt myself a moral and accountable being;
and, as such, I could not do otherwise. I have done
so, in the second place, because I was your representative,
and believed myself to be acting in conformity with
your wishes, with the wishes of the Whig party of
Massachusetts, and of my constituents generally. Have
I been mistaken? [A volley of noes.]</p>

<p>To ascertain what were the wishes of the Whig
party, and of those who put me in nomination, I
shall refer you to a series of the resolutions of conventions,
and of the declarations of the best accredited
authorities of that party, on this subject, for years past.
The following are among the resolutions of the Whig
convention which assembled in this town, March, 1848,
to nominate a successor to the Hon. John Quincy
Adams. They were unanimously adopted:—</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>“<i>Resolved</i>, That the members of this convention, met together
for the purpose of nominating a candidate to supply
the vacancy existing in the eighth congressional district, mourn,
in common with the state and the nation, the event which
has deprived them of the services of that eminent son of Massachusetts,
whose voice was ever raised in the cause of freedom,
whose vast and varied powers, more than those of any
other statesman of his time, were devoted to the service of
his country, shedding light upon her institutions, and leading
her on in the path of duty, prosperity, and glory.</p>

<p>“<i>Resolved</i>, That the loss of his services in the halls of
Congress, at this time, is the more deeply to be deplored, when
his great weight of character, his influence, his talents, his
wisdom, his zeal, and indomitable energy would have been so
benignly felt upon the great questions of freedom and slavery,
which are to be discussed and settled for our newly-acquired<span class="pagenum" id="Page_371">[Pg 371]</span>
domain, stretching from the Gulf of Mexico to the Pacific
Ocean.</p>

<p>“<i>Resolved</i>, That it behooves us to unite upon a candidate
to represent this district upon the floor of Congress, whose
principles shall be in consonance with those of his predecessor,
whose fidelity to the great principles of human freedom shall
be unwavering, whose voice and vote shall on all occasions be
exercised in extending and securing liberty to the human
race.”</p>
</div>

<p>In September, 1848, the Whig state convention of
Massachusetts met at Worcester, when the following
resolution, among others, reported by the Hon. Joseph
Bell, of Boston, since then president of the Massachusetts
Senate, was unanimously adopted:—</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>“<i>Resolved</i>, That being impressed with a profound sense
of our responsibility, as the representatives of the Whigs of
Massachusetts, that responsibility which attaches to our words,
acts, and votes,—we cannot fail, on this occasion, as we have
never failed on any other general assemblage of the Whigs
of Massachusetts, to record, in the most solemn and deliberate
manner, our unqualified opposition to any extension of the
institution of slavery into our territory, or any acquisitions of
territory, for the purpose of such extension. On this question,
the voice of the Whigs of Massachusetts has been unwavering
and uniform, and never has that voice spoken with higher
eloquence and power than when our distinguished senator in
Congress, speaking for himself, and for the whole people of
the commonwealth, said, ‘I consent to no further extension
of the area of slavery in the United States, or to the further
increase of slavery representation in the House of Representatives.’”</p>
</div>

<p>In September of the same year, another Whig convention
assembled at this place, to nominate a candidate
for the Thirty-first Congress. My views, as recorded
by my votes on all the questions of slavery, and
as expressed in my speech, delivered on the 30th of
the preceding June, were then before the people. That<span class="pagenum" id="Page_372">[Pg 372]</span>
convention, among other resolutions, passed the following,
by acclamation:—</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>“<i>Resolved</i>, That we cordially approve of the course of
the Hon. Horace Mann, and that his position in regard to <i>free</i>
principles, <i>free</i> labor, and <i>free</i> speech, sustained with such
signal ability, was but a satisfactory fulfilment of the expectations
that we had when we nominated him to succeed the illustrious
Adams. Regarding the past as the best and only
honorable pledge of the future, this convention unanimously
present his name to the people of this district for reëlection.”</p>
</div>

<p>At the Whig state convention, held at Springfield,
September 29th, 1847, Mr. Webster said he would consent
to no extension of slavery. Are not the laws
which I have just read a consent?—full consent?
He claimed the Wilmot proviso as his “thunder,” and
said it had been stolen from him. Whether stolen
from him, or not, I do not decide. He certainly seems
to have lost possession of it; for we now find him thundering
on the other side;—yes, from the high Olympus
to which the votes of Massachusetts had elevated him, he
has hurled his bolts against the dearest interests of his
benefactors. But it is said we have registered these
acts of pro-slavery legislation, at the dictation of the
south, in order to save the Union. When Governor
Davis was once asked to surrender the rights of humanity
to save the Union, he retorted with the question,
“How many times have we got to save the
Union?” If we yield to every threat of disunion, we
shall have to save the Union whenever any factious
and unprincipled member of it shall threaten resistance
to the laws. Look at the present threat which has
been made by Texas. What resources has she wherewith
to oppose the general government? She has no
funds except a school fund of $34,000, which her
governor, in one of his late messages, declared to be
inviolably devoted to education. To be sure, since
this cry of rebellion has been raised, he has said that<span class="pagenum" id="Page_373">[Pg 373]</span>
this fund, which could be diverted for no useful purpose,
might be appropriated to the treasonable one of
resistance. But look at the amount of this fund,—$34,000.
Military men tell me it would not support a
single regiment of mounted rangers more than a month;
and all the more settled parts of Texas are at least one
month’s marching distance from Santa Fe, which is
the nearest point of attack. There was never any
thing more ridiculous than the threats of Texas, that
she will take armed possession of the eastern side of
the Rio Grande, if it be not surrendered to her. She
cannot even protect herself against the Indian tribes
that roam through the regions lying between her and
the people she threatens to subjugate. Will the disaffected
states of the south help her by munitions,
money, or men? The only states on which she could
place any reliance are Mississippi and South Carolina.
Could a military force be organized, and then marched
nearly a thousand, or nearly fifteen hundred miles,
across the country, to uphold the Texan banner on the
borders of the Rio Grande? Were expeditions to be
sent by sea, could not the mouth of the Mississippi,
the harbor of Charleston, and that gateway of the
Gulf of Mexico, which lies between the capes of Florida
and the West India Islands; ay, the whole Texan
coast itself, be blockaded and guarded, so as to make a
hostile irruption into New Mexico impossible? Talk
about Texan resistance to the government of these United
States, my fellow-citizens; it is so ridiculous that
nothing can be conceived which is not less ridiculous,
and which would, therefore, by the very comparison, relieve
the supposition of a portion of its nonsense. This
surrendering to the threat of disunion, is like the foolish
mother who gave her boy a sugar-plum to stop
swearing. Presently he belched out a stream of profanity;
and when the mother asked him why he did
so, he said, “I want more sugar-plums.” General<span class="pagenum" id="Page_374">[Pg 374]</span>
Taylor embraced the whole subject in a short sentence
when he said he was more afraid of Texan bonds than
of Texan bayonets. Their bonds have been ten thousand
times more powerful than their bayonets in consummating
this disastrous compromise.</p>

<p>But it is not only in conventions of the Whig party
that sentiments have been expressed wholly incompatible
with the great surrenders we have made. Such
sentiments have emanated from more authoritative
sources. They are the voice of our commonwealth,—the
repeated voice, reiterated again and again, through
a series of years. Let me select a few from among
the many resolves of the Massachusetts legislature,
covering the time, and preceding the time, that I
have been in Congress. The following was passed
in 1847:—</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>“<i>Resolved</i>, <i>unanimously</i>, That the legislature of Massachusetts
views the existence of human slavery within the limits
of the United States as a great calamity, an immense moral
and political evil, which ought to be abolished, as soon as that
end can be properly and constitutionally attained, and that its
extension should be uniformly opposed by all good and patriotic
men throughout the Union.”</p>
</div>

<p>Again, in 1849, the legislature of Massachusetts</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>“<i>Resolved</i>, That when Congress furnishes governments
for the territories of California and New Mexico, it will be its
duty to establish therein the fundamental principles of the
ordinance of seventeen hundred and eighty-seven, upon the
subject of slavery, to the end that the institution may be
perpetually excluded therefrom beyond every chance and
uncertainty.”</p>
</div>

<p>And again, during this present year, and not six
months ago, the same general court passed the following
resolve. I might read from the printed volume
of the “Acts and Resolves of 1850;” but I choose
to read from <i>this official circular</i> which I hold in my<span class="pagenum" id="Page_375">[Pg 375]</span>
hand, which is attested by the secretary of state, and
was sent to me at Washington, as to all the other
members of Congress from Massachusetts, so that we
might be informed of the views of the state government,
as well as of our respective constituencies, on
this important subject:—</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>“<i>Resolved</i>, That the people of Massachusetts earnestly
insist upon the application by Congress of the ordinance of
1787, with all possible sanctions and solemnities of law, to
the territorial possessions of the Union in all parts of the
continent, and for all coming time.</p>

<p>“<i>Resolved</i>, That the people of Massachusetts, in the maintenance
of these their well known and <i>invincible</i> principles,
expect that all their officers and representatives will adhere
to them at all times, on all occasions, and under all circumstances.”</p>
</div>

<p>And yet, in six months, we are called upon to support
these laws. Is this “all coming time”? Are
these “invincible principles” of the Massachusetts
Whig legislature to melt, like wax, when touched by
the breath of party? They notified me, under their
seal and sign-manual, that they expected “all their
officers and representatives to adhere to them, at all
times, on all occasions, and under all circumstances.”
And yet, before six months have elapsed, some of the
very men who voted to give me such instructions, or
injunctions, or whatever you please to call them, having
discarded their own solemn asseverations of principle,
now upbraid me because I, too, will not be recreant to
them. Is this what you are to expect from men whom
you have elected by your votes, and to whom the
momentous interests of millions, and the honor of the
country, have been confided, that their vows should
be like those of perfidious lovers, who swear “eternal
fidelity”—during the honey moon? We cannot
plead the excuse, in regard to these resolves, which a
certain hearer of Whitfield did, for appearing unmoved<span class="pagenum" id="Page_376">[Pg 376]</span>
at one of his pathetic discourses, while all others were
melted to tears. When asked why he, too, did not
weep, he replied that “he did not belong to that parish.”
We do belong to this parish. These are the
“acts and resolves” of our own state, fresh and
unsullied from the mint. We cannot deny their genuineness.
If we impute fraud any where, it must be
to the motives of those who passed them. Hear, too,
what Governor Briggs says on this same subject, in his
last inaugural address:—</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>“Entertaining no doubt of the constitutional power of Congress
to exclude slavery from its own territories, and believing
that such exclusion is demanded by the highest principles of
morality and justice, she never can consent to its extension
over one foot of territory where it now is not. If the other
free states concur with her in this resolution, the thing will be
done, and consequences left to themselves.”</p>
</div>

<p>Thus have the Whig party in this state, and its
executive, pledged themselves not to extend slavery
“one foot.” How many feet in the six hundred
thousand square miles, into which the legislation of
the last Congress permits slavery to enter?—which
legislation the Whig party is now called upon to indorse,—that
is, how many myriad pledges do they
require us to break?</p>

<p>Let me now quote from another high Whig authority,—General
James Wilson, of New Hampshire. For
many years, probably no man has been considered
a more authoritative expounder of Whig sentiment.
He has been employed by the party, or the organs
of the party, to traverse the country for the advocacy
of Whig principles, and has been every where listened
to with great acceptance. In Congress, he spoke as
follows:—</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>“I hold that Congress is bound to take care of the territories,
and so execute the trust as will best promote the interests
of those who may hereafter be entitled to the beneficial use.<span class="pagenum" id="Page_377">[Pg 377]</span>
As a member of this Congress, I feel that I sustain a part of
that responsibility, and it is my desire to acquit myself worthily
in meeting it. I desire so to acquit myself that my own
conscience will not upbraid me, and that when I shall pass
away, no reproach shall fall upon me, or my children after
me, for my acts here upon this momentous question. I have,
sir, an only son, now a little fellow, whom some of this committee
may have seen here. Think you that when I am
gone, and he shall grow up to manhood, and shall come forward
to act his part among the citizens of the country, I will
leave it to be cast in his teeth, as a reproach, that his father
voted to send slavery into those territories? No! O, no! I
look reverently up to the Father of us all, and fervently
implore him to spare that child that reproach. May God
forbid it!</p>

<p>“I have said that it is characteristic of the slave power to
accomplish all of its political purposes in this government. I
must now say that the power and influence of slavery over
the action of Congress is impaired, if not entirely gone.
[What an infinite mistake!] I make this declaration, not
because I have any confidence in the politicians of the day.
No, sir, I have none whatever. The politicians are just as
ready now to betray their constituents as they ever have
been. I am sorry to say there is evidence enough of this.
My confidence is in the people. They have taken the matter
into their own hands; they have brought themselves into
order of battle and line, without the word of command from
any political leader. Here they stand, with front rank, and
rear rank, and rank of file-closers in position, with bayonets
at a charge. They have spoken to their representatives
in a voice of thunder, and warned them against abandoning
their interests. They have bid them do it at their peril.
The constituents have challenged their representatives to
betray their trusts, and skulk and retreat upon them, <i>if they
dared</i>.</p>

<p>“And, sir, the constituencies have spoken ‘upon honor.’
They are determined, and will execute their purposes. There
was a time, when, if the slave power had any special work
to be done, and wanted a northern man to do it, they hunted
him up from New Hampshire. Little, unfortunate New<span class="pagenum" id="Page_378">[Pg 378]</span>
Hampshire was called upon to furnish the scavenger to do
the dirty work. That day, thank God, has gone by, and it
will not come again very soon. [Wait a short year, Mr.
Wilson, and see who the Hazael will be.]</p>

<p>“The north are not disposed to trespass or interfere with
the rights of the south. Where slavery exists within the
states, the northern people claim no right to interfere with it
by any political action of this government. The people ask
no action by Congress on the subject of slavery within the
states. But gentleman need not ask me for my vote to
extend the institution of slavery one single inch beyond its
present boundaries. Did I say an inch, Mr. Chairman?
Ay, I would not extend it one sixteen-thousandth part of a
hair’s breadth. I would not extend it, because it would be
doing an irretrievable wrong to my fellow-man; because it
would be doing irreparable wrong to those territories for
which we are now to legislate; because it would be doing
violence to nature and to nature’s God; and because it would
be a wicked and wanton betrayal of the trust confided to me
by the free, intelligent constituency which has done me the
honor to send me here.</p>

<p>“It shall not be in the power of any man to shake a menacing
finger at me, and look me in the face with a jibe of contempt,
and say to me, in the insulting language of a former
representative from Virginia, [Mr. <span class="smcap">Randolph</span>,] ‘we have
conquered you, and we will conquer you again; we have
not conquered you by the black slaves of the south, but by
the white slaves of the north.’ No, sir, that remark shall
never apply to me. Gentlemen need not talk to me, or
attempt to frighten me, by threats of dissolution of the Union.
Sir, I do not permit myself to talk, or even think of the dissolution
of the Union; very few northern men do. We all
look upon such a thing as impossible. But, sir, sir, if the
alternative should be presented to me of the extension of
slavery, or the dissolution of the Union, I would say, rather
than extend slavery, let the Union, ay, the Universe itself be
dissolved! Never, never will I raise my hand or my voice
to give a vote by which it can or may be extended. As God
is my judge, I cannot, I will not be moved from the purpose
I have now announced.”</p>
</div>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_379">[Pg 379]</span></p>

<p>And yet this same General Wilson did vote for
every one of these laws, excepting, perhaps, the last,
which passed in the night,—fit darkness for so dark
a deed,—and the next morning he was off for California.
How can such a man stop this side of Botany
Bay? Now, fellow-citizens, did you want me to disgrace
myself, and you, and human nature, too, by such
an act of flagrant apostasy? [A crash of noes.] Yet
if these measures are adopted and sustained by the
Whig party, and if those men who committed these
nefarious deeds are justified and upheld by you, then
how are you less guilty than General Wilson?<a id="FNanchor_16" href="#Footnote_16" class="fnanchor">[16]</a></p>

<p>Let me quote a passage or two from a speech delivered
by one of my colleagues in Congress, the Hon.
George Ashmun, who has, I believe, usually been
considered pretty good Whig authority. In a speech
made by him on the 27th of last March, referring to
the subjects of slavery in the territories and the recaption
of alleged fugitive slaves, he said,—</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>“But I am bound to say, however, if the south persist in
uniting to demand the entrance of slavery into our free territories,
I, for one, must conform to what are, at the same time,
the views of my constituents and the convictions of my own
judgment; and if I am driven to the alternative, I shall not
hesitate to vote for the proviso.”—<i>App. to Cong. Globe</i>, <i>1st
Sess. 31st Congress</i>, p. 401.</p>

<p>“While I desire to do every thing which may protect
the rights of property which are guarantied to citizens of
the slave states, I cannot consent to sacrifice the rights of
liberty which belong to the citizens of the free states. To
secure both these ends, I see no other mode than to have
those rights settled before legal tribunals, <i>by the verdicts
of juries and the judgments of courts</i>.... When a
colored man is seized in Massachusetts upon a claim that he
is the property of a citizen of a slave state, and he claims to
be a citizen of Massachusetts, and invokes the protection<span class="pagenum" id="Page_380">[Pg 380]</span>
of the laws of Massachusetts, is it to be said he may be
summarily sent away by the decree of any one magistrate
without the privilege of vindicating his title to his citizenship
before a jury of the country? Why, sir, it could not be
done in the case of a horse escaped from one state to another,
and found in the possession of a citizen. It could not be
taken by strong hand,—by force. The claimant must resort
to process of law. He must sue out his writ of replevin, and
the title of the defendant must be tried where he lives. That
defendant may be a negro; and surely, if without a trial by
jury you may not take that which he claims to be his property,
you can hardly claim to seize the man himself, and
carry him away, before his title to freedom has been tested by
a tribunal, as respectable, at least, and as safe, as that which
settles a title to his horse.”—<i>Ib.</i> p. 399.</p>
</div>

<p>And another of my colleagues, [Mr. <span class="smcap">Duncan</span>,] even
as late as the 7th of June last, emphatically declared,
in the House of Representatives, as follows:—</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>“If territorial bills are presented for the government of
New Mexico and Utah, I shall vote for the exclusion of
slavery from those territories.</p>
</div>

<p>Let me fortify these citations by another from one
of the acknowledged leaders of the Whig party,—the
Hon. Rufus Choate:—</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>“On all the great questions of the day, but just slavery;
on executive power, on internal improvement, on the protection
of labor, on peace, and the constitution, we mean to
remain the same party of Whigs, one and indivisible, from
Maine to Louisiana,—one vast incorporation of consentaneous
feeling throughout the land; and upon this question alone we
always differ from the Whigs of the south; and on that one
we propose simply to vote them down.”<a id="FNanchor_17" href="#Footnote_17" class="fnanchor">[17]</a></p>
</div>

<p>I will quote a passage also from a recent letter of
the Hon. Zeno Scudder, late a Whig president of the
Massachusetts Senate, and now a candidate of the
Whig party for Congress, in District No. 10:—</p>
<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_381">[Pg 381]</span></p>
<div class="blockquot">

<p>“I was at the Springfield convention when Mr. Webster
said, ‘Not another inch of slave territory; <i>no, not one inch</i>!’
By the aid of his remarks on that occasion, I was confirmed
in the views which I had before entertained, and have as yet
seen no reason to change them.</p>

<p>“In 1847, I had the honor and pleasure of recording my
‘yea’ in favor of the resolves ‘concerning the existence and
extension of slavery within the jurisdiction of the United
States,’ and ‘concerning the Mexican war and the institution
of slavery,’ which passed the legislature of last year; and had
I been a member of that body at its last session, I should have
given my support to the resolve ‘concerning slavery,’ which
was then passed.</p>

<p>“When I recorded my ‘yea,’ and advocated the resolves
of 1847, I did not suppose them to be <i>idle words</i>, written out
to be bandied about and declaimed upon in Massachusetts,
and be <i>laid snugly away</i>, if ever I should depart the jurisdiction.
I supposed them to involve great principles of human
freedom, which were to be applied throughout the length and
breadth of our country, whenever and wherever the time and
place might present legitimate opportunities therefor.”</p>
</div>

<p>At the Whig state convention held at Springfield in
1847, a resolution was submitted by Dr. Palfrey, “that
the Whigs of Massachusetts will support no men for
the offices of president and vice-president, but such as
are known by their acts, or declared opinions, to be
opposed to the extension of slavery;” and Mr. William
Dwight, then of Springfield, is reported to have said,
“You cannot vote for a candidate not known to be
opposed to slavery extension; <i>it would be guilt</i>.”</p>

<p>But, fellow-citizens, I might go on citing authorities
of this kind until sunset;—nay, until sunlight should
come round again, and still leave the greater part of my
resources untouched. I will refer you but to one
more,—a resolution passed at the late Whig state convention,
only a few days ago, which was as follows:—</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>“<i>Resolved</i>, That Massachusetts avows her unalterable determination
to maintain all the principles and purposes she<span class="pagenum" id="Page_382">[Pg 382]</span>
has in times past affirmed, and reäffirmed, in relation to the
extension of slavery; and the measure of success which has
attended her exertions is a new incentive to continue and
persevere in all constitutional efforts, till the great and good
work shall be accomplished and perfected.”</p>
</div>

<p>And now, gentlemen, let me ask you whether my
action has been in accordance with these sentiments,
as expressed by the highest acts of the party and the
most solemn resolutions of the state? [An acclamation
of yeas.]</p>

<p>Here, fellow-citizens, I come to the test question:
Did we, as true Whigs, and as honorable men, make all
these declarations in sincerity, meaning to stand by
them to the end; or was it done, from time to time, to
beguile a portion of our fellow-citizens of their votes,
on the vile doctrine that “all is fair in politics”?
Were we frank and in earnest, or were we hollow and
fraudulent?</p>

<p>I know very well what influences have been brought
to bear upon us. I know we are a people intent on
thriving, and on worldly prosperity. Every young
man amongst us sets out in life determined to better
his condition. This, to me, is no cause of regret, but
of rejoicing. If the spirit of thrift does not transgress
the limits of honor and duty, it is not only right but
laudable. The animal wants of man must be supplied
before he will develop his intellectual or moral
powers. You may find individuals who will be virtuous
amid want and privation,—heroes in virtue;—but
a virtuous community in rags and hunger, you will
never find. We must put society in a condition of
physical comfort, before it will rise to mental excellence.
I am an ardent advocate, therefore, of all measures tending
to increase the wealth of the country; but on this
ever-present and everlasting condition, that it is done
without a sacrifice of principles. Any enlargement of
business, any increase of profits, any augmentation of<span class="pagenum" id="Page_383">[Pg 383]</span>
wealth, gained by a community through a dereliction
from principle, is as insecure and as ignominious as the
gains of an individual through fraud, embezzlement, or
peculation.</p>

<p>For the purpose of rewarding our native labor, therefore,
I am for a protective tariff. Perhaps some persons
may be here present who dissent from this opinion;
but I came here to avow, and not to conceal my sentiments
and acts. It has always seemed to me that we
must protect our labor against foreign labor, or our
laborers at home will fall to the condition of the pauper
laborers abroad. In Manchester in England, and Glasgow
in Scotland, and many other manufacturing towns
in Great Britain, there are thousands of wretched, degraded
female operatives, who earn scarcely a shilling
a day. After their day’s work is done, they visit the
dram-shops, roam the streets till midnight, and if not
invited away by vicious men, they huddle by scores
into filthy lodging-houses, where they sleep, men and
women promiscuously, till morning summons them back
to their tasks. Now where labor is so scantily paid,
fabrics can be produced more cheaply; and if these
fabrics can be sent into this country, free of duty, they
will undersell ours, until the prices of our labor and the
condition of our laborers are reduced to theirs. Nothing
is left to protect our industry but the cheaper freight
of the materials, and that is too trifling a compensation
to be of any account. This is the whole philosophy
of the matter, and to me it has always seemed unassailable.</p>

<p>It has been thought and said that if we would yield
to the south on the slavery question, they would yield
to us on the tariff question. We have surrendered the
slavery question. Have we got the tariff? Have we
got any thing but disgrace in the eyes of the civilized
world? To me, it seems that our chance for a tariff is
greatly diminished. For the majority which is necessary<span class="pagenum" id="Page_384">[Pg 384]</span>
to enable us to pass a tariff law, we must depend
on our opponents. By our yielding to the south, their
party discipline has been immensely strengthened, and
it is now more difficult than ever to obtain their votes
for any measure conducive to northern interests. Besides,
they now say they will retain the tariff question
as an open one, in order to keep us on our good behavior.
What have those now to say for themselves,
who beguiled a portion of our people into the delusion,
that they might safely barter human rights for pecuniary
advantages, and have left to their dupes both the
loss of the advantages, and the disgrace of abandoning
their principles!</p>

<p>But an appeal is made to us to ratify this surrender
to the slave power, because of our love for the Union.
And is our love for the Union always to be converted,
or rather perverted, into a pro-slavery motive of action?
I join you all most cordially, I join any one, in avowing
my regard for the Union, and my resolution to
stand by it. But the Union ought to be so used as to
extend, and not to abridge human welfare. If, in order
to maintain the Union, we must sacrifice all the
great objects for which the Union was formed,—the
establishment of justice, the promotion of the general
welfare, and the securing of the blessings of liberty to
ourselves and our posterity,—then the Union no longer
represents a beneficent divinity but a foul Dagon, and
is worthy to be broken in pieces. A Union which
must be secured by such sacrifices as have been lately
made in New York, in behalf of the so called “Union
Meeting,” abolishes the benefits it was designed to secure.
Eight thousand signatures were obtained for
calling that meeting; but to procure them, whole
streets were scoured, and men were threatened with the
publication of their names, and the consequent loss of
southern custom, if they refused to join in the call.
Many were obliged to pay <i>hush money</i> to prevent exposure.<span class="pagenum" id="Page_385">[Pg 385]</span>
The New York idea is slavery and free trade.
Here, it is slavery and tariff. Both cities cannot get the
price of their surrender of principle.</p>

<p>No, fellow-citizens, the more we yield to the demands
of the south in order to save the Union, the
more we may and must. Their longing eyes are already
fixed on Cuba. There is more probability and
more danger to-day that Cuba will be annexed to this
government within five years, than there was of Texan
annexation five years before that event took place. I
lately said to a Louisianian, “You will soon be for
making a slave state of Cuba.” “No,” said he, “we
mean to make two of that.”</p>

<p>Gentlemen, I have already occupied your attention
too long. But I am constrained to make a few brief
remarks on a subject I would gladly avoid. The occasion
of your present meeting is known to all. Two
years ago, I was nominated by the Whigs of this district
as their candidate for the seat in Congress which
I now hold. By the favor of my fellow-citizens of all
parties, I received more than eleven thousand out of
about thirteen thousand votes cast at that election. I
felt assured at that time, that I agreed in all essential
articles of political faith with those who gave me their
support, otherwise I should not have accepted the office
at their hands. I have endeavored faithfully, and according
to the best of my ability, to carry out the
wishes which they then expressed, and which they
well knew that I held. Yet, during the last week, a
Whig convention, (so called,) assembled in this place
to nominate a candidate for the thirty-second Congress;
and, after some close voting, they nominated as my
successor, the Hon. Samuel H. Walley,—a gentleman,
I am happy to say, towards whom I have always sustained
relations of personal kindness. In the language
of the day, that convention threw me overboard. Now
it is known to my whole circle of private friends, that,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_386">[Pg 386]</span>
as soon as Congress passed these pro-slavery measures
to which I have adverted, my determination was formed
not to be a candidate for reëlection. I resolved to return
to the people, and labor at home instead of at
Washington, in the cause of human freedom. But it
was soon given out, in certain influential quarters, that
I should not be returned to Congress again, and that I
should be stigmatized by a rejection. Unsurpassed
efforts, as you all know, have been made to carry out
this threat; even the Secretary of State of the United
States has made it the occasion for a practical contradiction
of all he had ever said against bringing the influence
of the government to bear upon the freedom
of elections; and the proceedings of the last week’s
convention were the first instalment of the penalty
which I am to suffer for defending human rights and
unmasking their betrayers. It is said that the convention
of last week was a packed convention; that it
did not represent the wishes of the people. Decorum
forbids <i>me</i> to make any such charge, even though it
were probably true. In a few days, this point will be
settled by the sovereign of us all, at the ballot-box.<a id="FNanchor_18" href="#Footnote_18" class="fnanchor">[18]</a></p>

<p>But two or three points, to which I wish to call your
attention, are contained in the address put forth by the
meeting I have referred to. Let me premise, however,
that I take no exception to the fact that my acts
and opinions should be made the subject of examination
and criticism by any body of men, or by any man.
It is better that animadversion should be wrong than
that it should not be free. Like Aristides, I would
write the vote that should banish me, rather than to
fetter or control the voter’s will. And now, having
laid down these principles in favor of free speech for
others, I proceed to exemplify them for myself.</p>
<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_387">[Pg 387]</span></p>
<p>The first charge preferred against me, in the address,
is, that I said, in a letter dated on the 3d of May
last, and addressed to a portion of my constituents,<a id="FNanchor_19" href="#Footnote_19" class="fnanchor">[19]</a>
that I “sympathized on different points with different
parties, but was exclusively bound to none.” Upon
this, the address remarks, “If we understand his meaning,
it is ... that he cannot be our champion and
defend our cause, as our true representative should,
whenever and wherever called upon.” No, I reply
to this, I will not promise beforehand to be any man’s
“champion,” nor to defend any man’s “cause,”
“<i>whenever and wherever called upon</i>.” This would
be to proffer championship and allegiance to men and
measures whether they were right or wrong. If any
man offers to vote for me on such conditions, I deny
him my assistance and disdain his support. Perhaps I
do not know what I was made for; but one thing I
certainly never was made for, and that is, to put principles
on and off, at the dictation of a party, as a lackey
changes his livery at his master’s command.</p>

<p>Another remark in the address is, that the compromise
measures, so called, excepting the fugitive slave
law, were “wise, and that they gave to the free states
all they could reasonably ask.” What a stultification,
my friends, is this, of ourselves, of our party, and of
every department of our state government, for the last
ten years. What have you been doing, but resolving,
contending, and placing your words and deeds upon
the historical records of the state and the nation, against
the identical measures now declared to be “wise,” and
all for which the free states “could reasonably ask”?
I leave this point with a single remark. The address
excepts the fugitive slave law from the measures it
commends. Before another year is past, will not that
most execrable act in modern legislation be palliated
or adopted by those who voted for this address?</p>
<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_388">[Pg 388]</span></p>
<p>A third objection to my position is, that I regard the
question of the extension of slavery into our territories
as paramount to those questions of a pecuniary character,
on which we desire to obtain the favorable action
of the government. Let this objection against me
have its full force. I admit it, in all its length and
breadth. I do regard the question of human freedom
for our wide-extended territories, with all the public
and private consequences dependent upon it, both now
and in all futurity, as first, foremost, chiefest among
all the questions that have been before the government,
or are likely to be before it. When temporary
and commercial interests are put in competition with
the enduring and unspeakably precious interests of
freedom for a whole race, of liberty for a whole country,
and of obedience to the will of the Creator, my
answer is, “Seek ye first the kingdom of God and
his righteousness, and all these things shall be added
unto you.”</p>

<p>In an address delivered by Mr. Choate, in 1848, he
declared the slavery question to be of “transcendent
importance;” and for this sentiment he was universally
applauded. Wherein does “<i>paramount</i> importance”
so differ from “<i>transcendent</i> importance,” that
the one is to be applauded while the other is condemned?</p>

<p>Let me call your attention to one other remark in
the address, and I will leave it. It suggests that my
course in Congress on the slavery questions has been
unacceptable to the south, and that we ought to send
a representative who will conciliate them and obtain
their good will. Fellow-citizens, do you suppose that
any man can be true to the memory of the Pilgrim
fathers, and to the love of liberty they bequeathed us,
and at the same time true to the spirit of the Cavaliers,
and to the wishes of their slave-owning posterity?
Eighteen hundred years ago, it was said that no man<span class="pagenum" id="Page_389">[Pg 389]</span>
can serve two masters; but the cupidity of modern
times proposes the solution of a problem which Christ
declared to be impossible. My opinion is, that the
cause of all our present calamity, and of the enduring
dishonor of the late measures, is this very desire to
conciliate southern favor, instead of giving a manful
defence to northern rights.</p>

<p>Finally, fellow-citizens, it is our fortune to live during
a great historic crisis in the affairs of the world.
This is the age of the useful arts; of discoveries and
inventions, which are filling with wealth the garners
and the coffers of men. It is the age of commerce, of
profit, of finance. One part of our nature is intensely
stimulated. Let us beware of the effect of this stimulus
upon that nobler portion of our being, which no
splendor of opulence nor profusion of luxuries can ever
satisfy; which demands allegiance to God, and justice
and humanity towards our fellow-men; and which
must have them, or die the second death. We may
be poor; but let us deprecate and forefend the most
calamitous of all poverties,—a poverty of spirit. We
may be subjected to great sacrifices; but let us sacrifice
every thing else, nay, life itself, before we sacrifice
our principles. I commend to you the language of the
good Bishop Watson, who, when tempted to stifle the
expression of his convictions through the hope of kingly
patronage, replied, that it was “Better to seek a fortuitous
sustenance from the drippings of the most barren
rock in Switzerland, with freedom for his friend,
than to batten as a slave at the most luxurious table
of the greatest despot in the world.”</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Mr. Chairman</span>;</p>

<p>Some time ago, I prepared a few comments upon
those prominent measures of the last session, which
have since arrested the attention of all the lovers of
constitutional liberty, and of moral and religious men,
throughout the civilized world. I am unwilling to
suffer the present session to close without expressing
the reflections I have formed; because I deem it but a
reasonable desire that my opinions should be placed
upon the records of the very Congress to whose
measures they refer.</p>

<p>Does any one ask what benefit I anticipate from a
discussion of this subject at the present moment? I
answer, this benefit at least: that of entering a solemn
protest against a grievous wrong, and of placing upon
the tablets of my country’s history, what I believe to
be the views of a vast majority of my constituents, in
common with the vast majority of the people of
Massachusetts.</p>

<p>Some of those compromise measures are destined to
be of great historic importance. They will be drawn
into precedent. When, in evil days, further encroachments
are meditated against human rights, these old
measures will be cited as a sanction for new aggressions;
and, in my view, they will always be found
broad enough, and bad enough, to cover almost any<span class="pagenum" id="Page_391">[Pg 391]</span>
nameable assault upon human liberty. When bad
men want authority for bad deeds, they will only have
to go back to the legislation of Congress, in 1850, to
find an armory full of the weapons of injustice.</p>

<p>Sir, legislative precedents are formidable things. If
created without opposition, and especially if acquiesced
in without complaint, they become still more formidable.
Now, if there were no other reasons for reviving
this subject at the present session of Congress,
this alone would be an ample justification,—it forefends
the argument from acquiescence.</p>

<p>When several of these measures were passed, and particularly
when one of the most obnoxious and criminal
of them all was passed,—I mean the Fugitive Slave
bill,—this House was not a deliberative body. Deliberation
was silenced. Those who knew they could not meet
our arguments, choked their utterance. The previous
question, which was originally devised to curb the
abuse of too much debate, was perverted to stop all
debate. The floor was assigned to a known friend of
the bill, who after a brief speech in palliation of its
enormities, moved the previous question; and thus we
were silenced by force, instead of being overcome by
argument. For, sir, I aver, without fear of contradiction,
that the bill never could have become a law, had
its opponents been allowed to debate it, or to propose
amendments to it. For the honor of the country,
therefore, at the present time, and for the cause of
truth hereafter, it is important that the hideous features
of that bill, which were then masked, should be now
unmasked. The arguments which I then desired and
designed to offer against it, I mean to offer now. Those
arguments have lost nothing of their weight by this
enforced delay, and I have lost nothing of my right to
present them.</p>

<p>Mr. Chairman, I feel none the less inclined to discuss
this question, because an order has gone forth that it<span class="pagenum" id="Page_392">[Pg 392]</span>
shall not be discussed. Discussion has been denounced
as agitation, and then it has been dictatorially proclaimed
that “agitation must be put down.” Sir,
humble as I am, I submit to no such dictation, come
from what quarter or from what numbers it may. If
such a prohibition is intended to be laid upon me personally,
I repel it. If intended to silence me as the
representative of the convictions and feelings of my
constituents, I repel it all the more vehemently. In
this government, it is not tolerable for any man, however
high, or for any body of men, however large, to
prescribe what subjects may be agitated, and what may
not be agitated. Such prescription is at best but a
species of lynch law against free speech. It is as
hateful as any other form of that execrable code; and
I do but express the common sentiment of all generous
minds, when I say that for one, I am all the more disposed
to use my privilege of speech, when imperious
men, and the sycophants of imperious men, attempt to
ban or constrain me. In Italy, the pope decides what
books may be read; in Austria, the emperor decides
what books may be written; but we are more degraded
than the subject of pontiff or Cæsar, if we are to
be told what topics we may discuss. If the subjects of
a despotic government are bound to be jealous even of
the poor privileges which they possess, how sensitive,
how “tremblingly alive all o’er” ought we to be at
these threatened encroachments upon freedom of speech
and freedom of thought. I think that those who say
so much about recalling us to a sense of our constitutional
obligations, would do well to remember, that the
very first article of the amendments to the constitution
secures the freedom of speech and the freedom of
the press. By the common consent of this country,
manifested in all forms for more than half a century,
the old alien and sedition law has been condemned.
Has that law been condemned for fifty years in order<span class="pagenum" id="Page_393">[Pg 393]</span>
to make our shame more conspicuous by its revival
under circumstances of intolerable aggravation? Sir,
I hold treason against this government to be an enormous
crime; but great as it is, I hold treason against
free speech and free thought to be a crime incomparably
greater.</p>

<p>If it be just and heroic to rebel against all arbitrary
invasions of free thought and free expression, then is
it not proportionably base and dastardly to utter menaces,
or threaten social or political disabilities for the
unconstrained exercise of these birthrights of freemen?
On the face of it, it must be a bad cause which will not
bear discussion. Truth seeks light instead of shunning
it. He convicts himself of wrong who refuses
to hear the arguments of his opponent. It was well
said by Montesquieu, that “the enjoyment of liberty,
and even its support and preservation, consists in every
man’s being allowed <i>to speak his thoughts and lay
open his sentiments</i>.” Wherefore, then, in a country
hitherto reputed to be free, are we told that discussion
must be stopped, and agitation must be put down? It
seems as if, when a freeman debases his soul by lending
himself to the defence of slavery, God punishes
him on the spot by demoralizing his own nature with
that spirit of tyranny which belongs to slavery.
Wherein consists the advantage of a republican government
over a despotism, if the freedom of speech and
of the press, which can be strangled in the one by arbitrary
command, can be stifled in the other by obloquy
and denunciation?</p>

<p>It is remarkable, too, that of all the “agitators” in
the country, there are none more violent than those
who are agitating against agitation. Throughout the
north, that portion of the public press which volunteers
its influence to extend the domain of slavery, and
to maintain it by extra-constitutional laws, is constantly
provoking the agitation it denounces. What are these<span class="pagenum" id="Page_394">[Pg 394]</span>
so-called Union meetings in northern cities but an extensive
apparatus of agitation,—a piece of machinery
to manufacture and send abroad the very articles which
its managers declare to be contraband? Through
public assemblies, through the public press, and by
correspondence designed for the public eye, they are
shaking the common air to keep it calm; they are agonizing
and in convulsions for repose; they are vociferating
to maintain silence. In the most clamorous
days of anti-slavery, there never was half so much
said and written against the institution as is now said
and written for it. Sir, is the right of agitation to be
monopolized by those who denounce it? Is free
speech to be only on one side; and is it one of the offices
of free speech to silence the sentiments it dislikes?
I think this is the second time in the history of this
country, that an attempt has been boldly and unblushingly
made to stifle free discussion; and I do
not believe the fate of those who are now laboring to
accomplish so nefarious a purpose will be historically
more enviable than that of their prototypes, who
passed the far-famed law against seditious speeches
and writings.</p>

<p>Is it not extraordinary, too, that this interdict on
discussion should be applied to a subject which touches
the highest interests of man, and calls into fervid
action all the noblest faculties of his nature; which,
more than any thing else, tests the question whether a
man <i>is</i> man? We may discuss the question of bank
or sub-treasury, of tariff or free trade; but the only
subject too sacred to be approached, is slavery and its
aggrandizements. This is a free country, except when
a man wishes to vindicate the claims of freedom. All
other parts of the temple may be entered, but slavery
is the ark of the covenant, and whoso lays his profane
hands thereon must perish.</p>

<p>Sir, how comes it to pass that an institution which<span class="pagenum" id="Page_395">[Pg 395]</span>
even the enlightened heathen of old pronounced to be
iniquitous, and which eighteen added centuries of
Christian illumination have proved to be the sum of offences
against God and man, should now be protected,
not merely by constitutions and laws; but that a general
warfare should be waged against all those who
would restrain it within its present limits, and keep it
from arming itself with new weapons of oppression?
How comes it to pass that this should be done, not in
the despotisms of Austria and of Russia, but in republican
America? Sir, it is not to be done, and cannot
be done. Almighty God has so constituted the human
soul, that while wrong exists upon the face of the
earth, all the noblest impulses of that soul will war
against it. The order of nature will war against it.
“The stars in their courses” will war against it. Discussion,
or agitation, if you so please to call it, is one of
the Heaven-appointed means by which truth is to be
spread until it covers the face of the earth, as the
waters cover the sea. It was by discussion and by
agitation, in synagogue and in temple, in distant cities
and in different empires, that Christianity was carried
from its cradle in Jerusalem to the ends of the earth.
Did not the disciples of Jesus Christ go “agitating”
from city to city, from Palestine to Greece, and from
Greece to Rome, notwithstanding they were imprisoned
and scourged, flayed alive, and burnt, and persecuted
as incendiaries and fanatics, by scribe, and Pharisee,
and high priest? The very accusation brought
against the Savior was, “He stirreth up the people,
teaching throughout all Jewry, beginning from Galilee
to this place.” The subject on which anti-slavery
men now “agitate” is inferior only in importance to
that on which Christ and his disciples “agitated.”
Nay, the only cause why Christianity has not prospered
as it ought during the last eighteen centuries, and
why it has not already overspread the whole earth with<span class="pagenum" id="Page_396">[Pg 396]</span>
its blessings, is, that <span class="allsmcap">LIBERTY</span> has not been given it as
a sphere to work in. It is because <span class="allsmcap">SLAVERY</span> has existed
among men; and Christianity never will and never
can pervade the earth until the barriers of slavery are
first overthrown. It was by discussion and agitation
that the prevailing religion of this country,—the
Protestant religion,—broke through the double phalanx
of civil and sacerdotal power, and triumphed
throughout the leading nations of Europe, under the indomitable
energy of that old hero of Wittemburg,
who did not heed nor fear that prince of the slave
power, the incarnate devil himself. It was by discussion
and agitation that the first glowing sparks of liberty
in the bosom of the Adamses, of Hancock, and
of Franklin, of Thomas Jefferson and of Patrick
Henry, were fanned into a flame that consumed the
hosts of the tyrant,—that tyrant who sought to put
down this dreadful agitation by means not a whit more
reprehensible in his day, than those by which certain
leading men are striving to silence it now. Where was
there ever written or published a more incendiary and
fanatical document than the Declaration of Independence?—a
torch to set the world on fire. In the
present century, what but discussion and agitation,
through all the realms of Great Britain and in this
country, could have sufficed to extinguish the slave
trade,—that foulest blot upon modern civilization?
No, sir; agitation is a part of the sublime order of
nature. In thunder, it shakes the stagnant air, which
would otherwise breed pestilence. In tempests, it
purifies the deep, which would otherwise exhale miasma
and death. And in the immortal thoughts of
duty, of humanity, and of liberty, it so rouses the
hearts of men that they think themselves inspired of
God; and not the mercenary clamor of the market-place,
nor the outcries of politicians, clutching at the
prizes of ambition, can suppress the utterances which<span class="pagenum" id="Page_397">[Pg 397]</span>
true men believe themselves Heaven-commissioned to
declare.</p>

<p>The President’s message tells us that the compromise
measures of the last session are “<span class="allsmcap">FINAL</span>.” I take
the liberty to say of that declaration in the message,
with all due respect to the high source from which it
comes, that I adopt the sentiment, that those measures
are <i>final</i>, in one sense only. Their substance and object
were, in an extreme degree, pro-slavery and anti-liberty.
They marked the passage of this government
through another long stage in the gloomy highway of
oppression. They furnished another argument for
those who despair of human nature; and they supply
the misanthrope with a plausible reason for hating
mankind. They affixed another stain upon the country,
and set in deeper shade the contrast between the
theory of our government and its practice. They belied
still another time the gospel of love and human
brotherhood. Once again they defied the vengeance
of God, who is no respecter of persons, and who will
bring the sinner to judgment. If such measures are to
be “<i>final</i>,” in this sense only do I accept the proposition,—that
they are to be the last of their kind; that
here, at this point, the career of this iniquity is to be
stayed; that here, the confederated powers of ambition
and of wealth,—of those who aspire to office and
those who lust for gold, have won their last victory.
In this sense only do I accept the President’s declaration,
that the action of the last Congress on this subject
is to be deemed <i>final</i>;—that, in all future conflicts, the
right shall not be trampled under foot, but the victims
of oppression shall triumph. Base as human nature
often proves itself to be, it sometimes manifests a divine
resilience by which it springs with recuperative
energy from its guilty fall.</p>

<p>I draw no augury of despair from the calamity that
has befallen us. It teaches whatever there is of virtue<span class="pagenum" id="Page_398">[Pg 398]</span>
and of principle in mankind, the task which has been
set them to do, and whose accomplishment God will
require at their hands.</p>

<p>It has been said by the Secretary of State, in a late
speech, that if this subject be reöpened in Congress,
the friends of freedom will be found in a “lean and
miserable minority.” What cares my conscience, sir,
whether I am in a minority or a majority, <i>if I am
right</i>? Has any great and glorious cause ever been
started upon earth, that did not find itself, at the outset,
in a minority? Did Clarkson and Wilberforce
open their twenty years’ contest with a majority? or
were not all the office-seekers and mammon-worshippers
opposed to them? Did the resistance of the revolutionary
patriots to the government of Great Britain
start with a majority on its side? Did the Pilgrim
fathers resist conformity to ecclesiastical oppression
because they were a majority of the people? Did the
glorious band of reformers count on majorities, when
they defied the racks and the flames of Rome? What
would now be our condition if the prophets and heroes
of olden days, if the warriors for truth and the martyrs
of liberty, all over the earth, had yielded to so base an
argument as this, and had followed the multitude to do
evil, instead of battling for the truth, though it were
solitary and alone? I can conceive of but one effect
which such a sentiment must produce upon all noble
and truth-loving men. It is to make them labor for
the right with a zeal commensurate with the infinite
baseness of the appeal by which they are urged to
abandon it.</p>

<p>But I come now, Mr. Chairman, to the main topic
of my remarks, which is a consideration of the character
of the Fugitive Slave law, passed on the 18th day
of September last.</p>

<p>The objections most generally urged against this
law are of two kinds:</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_399">[Pg 399]</span></p>

<p>1st. That it is unconstitutional; and</p>

<p>2d. That, even if the framers of the constitution
did leave an unguarded opening, through which such
a law could be introduced without a breach in the
structure of that instrument, still, that it is a cruel law,
that it discards all those principles of evidence and
forms of proceeding which have been devised by the
wisdom of ages for the protection of innocence against
power, and that in its whole scope and spirit it is in
conflict with our fundamental ideas of human liberty.</p>

<p>It will be seen by this statement, that I here accept
the constitution according to its commonly-received
interpretation. There is a class of defenders of this
law whom I wish to meet on their own ground. I do
not, therefore, object here to the constitution as they
understand it, but to the law. However much a man
may reverence the constitution, though he may make
it an idol and worship it, yet I mean to show him that
this law is an unholy thing in its presence. I object,
then, to the law as a departure from the constitution,—not
a departure <i>towards</i> despotism merely, but <i>into</i>
despotism. Admitting, what many deny, that when
the constitution speaks of “persons held to service or
labor,” it means slaves, and admitting that it provides
for their reclamation when it says they “shall be delivered
up on claim,” I still impeach the Fugitive Slave
law for high crimes and misdemeanors against the
spirit and the letter of that instrument.</p>

<p>On the question of the constitutionality of this law,
the legal minds of the country are divided. It may
not be easy to distribute opinions correctly, on this
point, into their proper classes, and to decide upon
their relative preponderance. If we include slave owners
and those whose pecuniary interests connect them
directly with slavery, and especially if to those we add
a strong party who, from political associations and
hopes, have surrendered themselves to a pro-slavery<span class="pagenum" id="Page_400">[Pg 400]</span>
policy, probably the number, if not the weight, of
opinion, is in favor of the constitutionality of the law.
But if we gather the opinions of disinterested and unbiased
men; of those who have no money to make or
office to hope for through the triumph of the law, then
I think the preponderance of opinion is decidedly the
other way. I know it has been said by one prominent
individual, that he has heard of no man, whose opinion
was worth regarding, who denied the constitutionality
of the law. Now, as it is a fact universally known,
that gentlemen who have occupied and adorned the
highest judicial stations in their respective states, together
with many of the ablest lawyers in the whole
country, have expressed opinions against the constitutionality
of this law, I have but one single word of
reply to a declaration so arrogant and insolent as this.
That reply is, that on a great moral and political, as
well as legal question,—a question that connects itself
with ethics, as well as with partisan politics, and the
success of old parties or the formation of new ones,—<i>integrity</i>
is as necessary to the formation of a sound
opinion as <i>intelligence</i>.</p>

<p>I think, however, that one further remark should in
candor be made, in regard to the difference of opinions
held by honest men on this subject. The constitutionality
or unconstitutionality of the Fugitive Slave law
is not a question to be determined solely by any single
and simple provision of the fundamental law. Numerous
clauses in the constitution have a bearing upon
it. It connects itself with contemporaneous history.
It presents a case where commentators and expounders
must appeal to precedents and analogies, and to general
principles respecting the nature of government and the
object of all law. It is therefore a question of construction
and interpretation. And, what is a more important
consideration still, it belongs emphatically to
that class of cases where men, who have been trained<span class="pagenum" id="Page_401">[Pg 401]</span>
under one class of institutions, and whose minds have
been moulded and shaped by the universal prevalence
of one set of opinions and one course of practice, may
honestly come to one conclusion, while those who
have grown up under adverse opinions and an adverse
practice,—or rather, into whose minds adverse opinions
and adverse practices have grown, until they have
become a part of the very substance of those minds,—may
honestly come to an opposite conclusion. We
know, too, that in addition to the powerful influences
of education and training, the general cast and structure
of men’s minds predispose them to take one side
or the other of great political and religious questions.
Natural biases operate like a law of gravitation to sway
different minds in different directions. When, therefore,
a southern gentleman, into whose perceptions and
reasonings and moral sentiments, the facts and the creed
of slavery have been incorporating themselves ever
since he was born, tells me that he believes even such
a law as this to be constitutional, I can still concede
the fulness of his integrity, however strongly I may
dissent from the soundness of his opinion. It is a law
that might be held constitutional by a bench of slaveholders,
while it would be held unconstitutional by all
the inhabitants of a free land. It is a law that might
be held valid by the courts of Austria, while it would
be held invalid by those of England. It is a law
which the judges of Westminster Hall might have
held valid in the time of the Stuarts, which they might
and probably would have held invalid in the eighteenth
century; and, in the nineteenth century, would certainly
have reprobated and annulled.</p>

<p>My own opinion is, in view of the great principles
of civil liberty out of which the constitution grew,
and which it was designed to secure, that this law cannot
be fairly and legitimately supported on constitutional
grounds. I express this opinion because, after<span class="pagenum" id="Page_402">[Pg 402]</span>
having formed it with careful deliberation, I am now
bound to speak from it, and to act from it. I have
read every argument, and every article in defence of
the law, that I could find, from whatever source emanating.
Nay, I have been more anxious to read the
arguments made in its favor than the arguments against
it; and I think I have seen a sound legal answer to all
the former. As for any arrogant or supercilious dictum,
either that the law is constitutional or that it is
not constitutional, unaccompanied by any reason or
any reference, all reflecting men must regard it as sheer
insolence, come from what quarter it may.</p>

<p>Even should the supreme court of the United States
declare the law to be constitutional, then, though we
must acknowledge their decision, as to the point decided,
to be the law of the land, until it is set aside,
yet, without any disrespect to that tribunal, we may
still adhere to our former opinion. We know how
that court is constituted. A majority of its members
are from slaveholding states. Independent, too, of all
other considerations, they will feel a strong desire to
maintain a former opinion, which was also given when
a majority of its judges were from the south. We
may, therefore, place our dissent on grounds which,
two years ago, when the “Clayton compromise,” so
called, was under discussion, were so well stated by a
distinguished senator from Ohio, [Mr. <span class="smcap">Corwin</span>,]—grounds
perfectly respectful on our part, and not derogatory
to the court. He said,—</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>“It is a sad commentary upon the perfection of human reason,
that, with but few exceptions, gentlemen coming from a
slave state ... all eminent lawyers on this floor, from that
section of the country, have agreed that you have no right to
prohibit the introduction of slavery into Oregon, California,
and New Mexico; while, on the other hand, there is not a
man, with few exceptions, (and some highly respectable,) in
the free states, learned and unlearned, clerical or lay, who has<span class="pagenum" id="Page_403">[Pg 403]</span>
any pretensions to legal knowledge, but believes in his conscience
that you have a right to prohibit slavery.... How
is this? Can I have confidence in the supreme court of the
United States, when my confidence fails in senators around
me here? <i>Do I expect that the members of that body will be
more careful than the senators from Georgia and South Carolina
to form their opinions without any regard to selfish considerations?</i>”</p>
</div>

<p>Besides, the supreme court have already, as I will
show, decided certain points in such a way that, if
they maintain the Fugitive Slave law, they will be
obliged to overrule those points; and it is more creditable
to them to suppose they will overrule their decision
in Prigg’s case, than to suppose they will overrule other
decisions in other cases.</p>

<p>In the first place, I believe the constitution not only
authorizes but requires a trial by jury, in the case of
alleged fugitive slaves, when claimed in free states.</p>

<p>The constitution declares, “The right of the people
to be secure in their persons,” “against unreasonable”
“seizures, shall not be violated; and no warrant shall
issue but upon probable cause, <i>supported by oath or
affirmation</i>, and particularly describing” “the persons
or things to be seized.”—<i>Amend.</i>, Art. IV.</p>

<p>It also declares, that, “In suits at common law,
where the value in controversy shall exceed twenty
dollars, the right of trial by jury shall be preserved.”—<i>Amend.</i>,
Art. VII.</p>

<p>And it also says, “No person shall be deprived of
life, liberty, or property, without due process of law.”
<i>Amend.</i>, Art. V. And it is most important to observe
that these words, “due process of law,” are held by
all the authorities <i>to include the trial by jury</i>.—3
<i>Story’s Com.</i> 661; 2 <i>Inst.</i> 50, 51; 2 <i>Kent’s Com.</i> 10;
1 <i>Tucker’s Black. App.</i> 304-5.</p>

<p>That there may be no doubt about the meaning and
force of these words, I quote the following passage
from Chancellor Kent:—</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_404">[Pg 404]</span></p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>“It may be received as a self-evident proposition, universally
understood and acknowledged throughout the country,
that no person can be taken or imprisoned, or disseized from
his freehold, or liberties, or estate, or exiled, or condemned,
or deprived of life, liberty, or property, unless by the law of
the land, or the judgment of his peers. The words, ‘by the
law of the land,’ as used by the Magna Charta, in reference
to this subject, are understood to mean ‘due process of law.’
That is, <i>by indictment or presentment of good and lawful
men</i>.”—2 <i>Com.</i> 13.</p>
</div>

<p>Now, in most of the cases which will arise under
the Fugitive Slave law, there will be a “seizure” under
a warrant; and in <i>all</i> the cases, the questions both
of property and of liberty will necessarily be involved.
In every case, the claimant will aver property in the
respondent, and will seek to deprive him of his liberty.
The respondent will deny the claim of property, and
will seek to retain his liberty.</p>

<p>Now, suppose a man to have lived in Boston or
New York for twenty years; to have contracted marriage;
to have bought and sold; to have hired himself
out to others, and to have hired others to serve him;
to have pleaded and been impleaded in the courts; to
have voted at elections, and to be, in all respects, as
free by the constitutions of Massachusetts and New
York as the governors of those states themselves; and
suppose further, that this man is suddenly seized and
taken before a commissioner, is adjudged the property
of another man like himself, with no chance of revising
the decision, or of having a new trial, is placed in
duress, and then transported by force, and against his
will, to a distant state, under a claim that he is a slave,
and an adjudication that such claim is true,—suppose
all this, I say, and then answer me this simple question,
Has, or has not, such a man been “deprived of his
liberty”? In other words, does such a man retain
his liberty? As he is borne away by force, and against<span class="pagenum" id="Page_405">[Pg 405]</span>
prayers, and tears, and struggles, does he remain free?
Can a man be adjudged a slave; held, coerced, beaten
as a slave; with all his powers and faculties of body
and mind subdued and controlled as a slave’s, and yet
possess or retain liberty? If such a proceeding does
not deprive a man of his freedom, by what means can
he be deprived of it? What <i>more</i>, or what <i>other thing</i>
would you do to deprive him of it? Would binding
him out to serve for life deprive him of it? This declares
that he owes service for life. Would imprisonment
deprive him of it? This imprisons him, and
makes the man his keeper who is interested to make
that imprisonment perpetual in himself, and descendible
to his children, and his children’s children forever.</p>

<p>Is not perpetual imprisonment of the nature and substance
of punishment,—of the severest punishment?
The constitution has provided that “cruel and unusual
<i>punishments</i> shall not be inflicted,” even for the perpetration
of the worst of crimes; yet here is a case where
the most cruel of punishments, or of privations, may
be inflicted without even a charge of crime. And the
argument is, that this form of punishment may constitutionally
be inflicted, because it was so inconceivably
atrocious and diabolical that the constitution did not
prohibit it,—because the constitution only prohibited
“cruel and unusual punishments” <i>for crimes</i>, and not
for having a dark skin.</p>

<p>Does any one say that a victim of this law has not
been “deprived” of his liberty because he may sue for
it, and possibly recover it, in the courts of the state to
which he is carried? I reply, that it would be just as
good an answer to say, that he may possibly recover
his liberty by escape, or possibly his master may emancipate
him, or possibly a St. Domingo insurrection may
break out, or possibly the walls of his prison-house
may be shaken down by an earthquake, and he may
go forth like Paul and Silas; and <i>therefore</i> he is not<span class="pagenum" id="Page_406">[Pg 406]</span>
deprived of his liberty by being enslaved. Neither of
these events would have the slightest legal relation to
the proceedings which did enslave him. Neither of
them would be retroactive, undoing or annulling the
past. Enslavement and liberty being incompatible,
when he suffers the first, though but for an hour, he is
deprived of the last. The moment he should arrive
within the limits of a slave state, that moment he would
be in the same condition as three million other fellow-bondmen;
and it would be just as rational to say that
they have never been deprived of liberty as that he has
not. When our government made war upon Algiers,
ransoming American captives from their horrible bondage
and restoring them to their homes, did it annihilate
the preëxisting fact that they had been enslaved?
Did it enable or authorize the historian to say that
they had never been <i>deprived of their liberty</i>? Had
Algiers been “reännexed” as one of the states of this
Union, could she have said, “We have not broken the
constitution because these men are free again”? I affirm,
then, that when a man in Massachusetts, who by the
constitution of Massachusetts is free, is adjudged to be
a slave, is transported as a slave, and held as a slave, in
a southern state, though it be but for a single day, he is
deprived of his liberty. That very thing is done to him
which the constitution says shall not be done but by a
jury of his peers.</p>

<p>But a question of <span class="allsmcap">PROPERTY</span> is involved as well as a
question of liberty. “In suits at common law,” says
the constitution, “where the value in controversy shall
exceed twenty dollars, the right of trial by jury shall
be preserved.”</p>

<p>Now, sir, in regard to this important clause in the
fundamental law, I propose to demonstrate the three
following propositions:—</p>

<p>First; the claim, made before a competent magistrate,
for a “person held to service or labor,” is, in view
of this constitutional provision, a “suit.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_407">[Pg 407]</span></p>

<p>Second; it is a “suit at common law.”</p>

<p>Third; it is a suit at common law “where the value
in controversy exceeds twenty dollars.”</p>

<p>As a law term, the lexicographers define the word
“suit” to mean “an action or process for the recovery
of a right or claim; legal application to a court for justice;
prosecution of right before any tribunal;—as a
civil <i>suit</i>, a criminal <i>suit</i>, a <i>suit</i> in chancery.”</p>

<p>Blackstone says, “in England, the several <i>suits</i>, or
remedial instruments of justice, are distinguished into
three heads,—actions, personal, real, and mixed.”</p>

<p>“Suit” comes from “<i>secta</i>,” and <i>secta</i> from <i>sequor</i>;
and the phrase “to bring suit,” denoted anciently, to
bring <i>secta</i>,—followers, or witnesses, to prove the
plaintiff’s demand. The scope of the word is now
enlarged, so that it embraces the written forms by
which an action is instituted, as well as the proof
which sustains it.</p>

<p>We are not, however, confined to the authority of
the dictionary. The supreme court, in the case of
<i>Cohens</i> vs. <i>Virginia</i>, 6 Wheat. 407, where this very
word “suit,” as it occurs in the constitution, was the
subject of consideration, defined it as follows:—</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>“What is a <i>suit</i>? We understand it to be the prosecution,
or pursuit, of some <i>claim</i>, demand, or request. In law language,
it is the prosecution of some demand, in a court of
justice. ‘The remedy for every species of wrong is,’ says
Judge Blackstone, ‘the being put in possession of that right
whereof the party injured is deprived.’ The instruments
whereby this remedy is obtained, are a diversity of <i>suits</i> and
actions, which are defined by the Mirror to be ‘the lawful
demand of one’s right;’ or, as Bracton and Fleta express it,
in the words of Justinian, ‘<i>jus prosequendi in judicio quod
alicui debetur</i>,’—(the form of prosecuting in trial, or judgment,
what is due to any one.) Blackstone then proceeds to
describe every species of remedy by suit; and they are all
cases where the party suing claims to obtain something to
which it has a right.</p>
</div>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_408">[Pg 408]</span></p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>“To commence a suit, is to demand something by the institution
of process in a court of justice; and to prosecute the
suit, is, according to the common acceptation of language, to
continue that demand.”</p>
</div>

<p>Now let me take the different clauses of this definition,
and see if every one of them does not necessarily
include the demand made by a slave claimant against
the alleged slave.</p>

<p>“We understand a suit,” say the court, “to be the
prosecution or pursuit of some <i>claim</i>, demand, or request.”
Here, then, according to the supreme court,
a <i>suit</i> is the prosecution of some <i>claim</i>; and, according
to the very letter of the constitution, the fugitive
slave is to be delivered up, on <i>claim</i>. The slave, then,
can be constitutionally and legally “delivered up” in
no other way than “on claim,” by “suit.”</p>

<p>Again, say the court: “In law language, it [a suit]
is the prosecution of some demand in a court of justice.”
When legal process is instituted for the recovery
of a slave, is it not the prosecution of a demand?
And will any one be rash enough to say that a man
ostensibly free,—free according to all legal presumption,—can
be “delivered” over to bondage for life,
without the intervention of “a court of justice”?</p>

<p>To proceed with the opinion of the court: “The
Mirror defines a suit to be ‘the lawful demand of one’s
right;’ or, as Bracton and Fleta express it, in the words
of Justinian, it is the form of prosecuting in trial, or
judgment, what is due to any one.” Here service is
alleged to be due; and the one who is said to owe that
service is “prosecuted by trial and judgment,” that he
may render the service claimed.</p>

<p>“To commence a suit is to demand something by
the institution of process in a court of justice; and to
prosecute the suit is, according to the common acceptation
of language, to continue that demand.” In the
appeal to a court for the possession of an alleged fugitive,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_409">[Pg 409]</span>
is not something “demanded”? And what is the
warrant that is issued for his arrest but the “institution
of process”?</p>

<p>If any one, then, will show that a “claim” for an
alleged fugitive, by process of law, to be followed up
by proof in support of the claim, and to be consummated
by judgment, is not a “suit,” he must show
that it is not “the prosecution or support of a claim;”
he must show that it is not “the prosecution of some
demand in a court of justice;” he must show that it is
not “the lawful demand of one’s right;” nor “the
form of prosecuting in trial or judgment;” and finally,
he must show that it is not “to demand something by
the institution of process in a court of justice,” and then
“to continue that demand” until judgment is rendered
for or against him.</p>

<p>But should the claimant of a fugitive slave show any
one of these four things, he would show himself the
way out of court.</p>

<p>And this brings me to the <i>second</i> proposition,
namely,—</p>

<p>The claim for a person “held to service or labor”
is, in view of the constitution, a “<i>suit at common
law</i>.”</p>

<p>In a decision bearing directly on the right to a trial
by jury, the supreme court has defined the phrase
“suits at common law,” in special reference to its
meaning in the seventh amendment to the constitution,
where the right to such trial, “in suits at common
law,” is secured. These are their words:—</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>“It is well known that in civil causes, in courts of equity
and admiralty, juries do not intervene; and that courts of
equity use the trial by jury only in extraordinary cases, to inform
the conscience of the court. When, therefore, we find
that the [seventh] amendment requires that the right of trial
by jury shall be preserved in suits at common law, the natural
conclusion is, that this distinction was present to the minds<span class="pagenum" id="Page_410">[Pg 410]</span>
of the framers of the amendment. By <i>common law</i> they
meant, what the constitution denominated in the third article,
‘law;’ not merely suits, which the <i>common</i> law recognized
among its old and settled proceedings; but suits, in which
<i>legal</i> rights were to be ascertained and determined, in contradistinction
to those in which equitable rights alone were recognized,
and equitable remedies were administered, or in which,
as in the admiralty, a mixture of public law, and of maritime
law and equity, was often found in the same suit. Probably
there were few, if any states in the Union, in which some new
legal remedies, differing from the old common law forms,
were not in use; but in which, however, the trial by jury intervened,
and the general regulations, in other respects, were
according to the course of the common law. Proceedings in
cases of partition, and of foreign and domestic attachment,
might be cited, as examples, variously adopted and modified.
<i>In a just sense, the amendment, then, may well he construed to
embrace all suits, which are not of equity or admiralty jurisdiction</i>,
<span class="allsmcap">WHATEVER MAY BE THE PECULIAR FORM WHICH THEY
MAY ASSUME TO SETTLE LEGAL RIGHTS</span>.”—<i>Parsons</i> vs. <i>Bedford</i>,
3 Peters’s Rep. 456-57.</p>
</div>

<p>Here the court say, that the term “common law,”
in the seventh amendment, meant what the constitution
denominated in the third article, “law.” The
word “law” which is here referred to, as contained in
the third article, occurs in the following sentence:
“The judicial power shall extend to all cases, in <i>law</i>
and equity, arising under this constitution, the laws of
the United States,” &amp;c. And the court declare that
the constitutional right to a jury trial embraces “not
merely suits, which the <i>common</i> law recognized among
its old and settled proceedings, but suits in which <i>legal</i>
rights were to be ascertained and determined,” in contradistinction
from equity and admiralty cases.</p>

<p>And in the last sentence of the decision quoted, the
court expressly say, that the seventh amendment embraces
“<i>all suits which are not of equity or admiralty
jurisdiction</i>, <span class="allsmcap">WHATEVER MAY BE THE PECULIAR FORM<span class="pagenum" id="Page_411">[Pg 411]</span>
WHICH THEY MAY ASSUME TO SETTLE LEGAL RIGHTS</span>.”
The court say “<span class="allsmcap">ALL</span>.” After excepting cases of
equity and admiralty jurisdiction, they declare that
the phrase, “suits at common law,” embraces <i>all</i> the
rest. They recognize no hybrid class, not included
under one or another of these heads.</p>

<p>Now it has been proved above, that a warrant for
the arrest of an alleged fugitive, together with the
allegations and proofs under it, constitute a “suit.”
And can any thing be more clear, than that a proceeding
which decides the issue, whether a man “owes”
or does not “owe;” which decides the issue, whether
a man has “escaped,” or has not “escaped;” and
which, as the legal consequence of these decisions, delivers
one man into the custody of another as his slave,
or enlarges one man from the custody of another because
he is not his slave, is, “whatever peculiar form
it may assume,” a proceeding “to settle a legal right,”—one
of the highest and most important legal rights
that appertain to a man? It is not, in legal language,
a right “of equity or admiralty jurisdiction,” but exclusively
and purely a <i>legal right</i>, and nothing else.</p>

<p>The court declare this to be so, <i>whatever peculiar
form the process may assume</i>. But what gives peculiar
pertinency and stringency to this decision of the
court is, that at common law there was an original
writ, called the writ <i>de homine replegiando</i>,—the writ
of personal replevin, or for replevying a man, by which
the question of property in a man might be determined.
It was a writ which the party could sue out of right;
one to be granted on motion, without showing cause,
and which the court of chancery could not supersede.
In the very language of the supreme court, it was a
writ recognized by the common law, and is to be found
“among its old and settled proceedings.” The form
of it is contained in that great arsenal of common law
writs, the <i>Registrum Brevium</i>.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_412">[Pg 412]</span></p>

<p>“A man,” says Comyn, “may have a <i>homine replegiando</i>
for a negro, or for an Indian brought by him
into England and detained from him; or it may be
brought by an infant against his testamentary guardian;
or <i>by a villein against his lord</i>.”—(Dig., title Imprisonment,
L. 4.)</p>

<p>If this writ could be brought “for a negro,” or “for
an Indian,” by a man who had introduced him into
England, and from whom he had been detained; and
if, on the other hand, it could be brought by the
negro, or by the Indian to gain his freedom, as was
clearly the case, then it follows that the question of a
right to a man, as well as that of human freedom, was
a question familiar to the ancient common law, and
for the trial of which a well-known process existed
“among its old and settled proceedings.” But this
ancient writ, <i>de homine replegiando</i>, carries with it, as
every body knows, the trial by jury, as much as an
action of assault and battery, or of assumpsit on a
promissory note.</p>

<p>I have always understood, that before the revolution,
and before the framing of our constitution, Comyn’s
Digest, from which the above citation is made, was a
work of the highest authority. It must have been well
known to all the lawyers in the convention. Could
they have intended that the mere fact of claiming a
man as a slave,—which claim might be made against
a freeman as well as against a slave,—should be sufficient
to deprive him of this ancient muniment of the
subject’s liberty? It seems impossible!</p>

<p>But we are not left to the broad and general assertion,
contained in the case of <i>Parsons</i> vs. <i>Bedford</i>,
that the seventh article of amendment embraces “all
suits” not of equity or admiralty jurisdiction, whatever
the peculiar form which they may assume to settle
legal rights. Authority exists still more pointed and
direct. In <i>Baker</i> vs. <i>Riddle</i>, Mr. Justice Baldwin,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_413">[Pg 413]</span>
one of the judges of the supreme court of the United
States, held that it was not in the power of Congress
to take away the right of trial by jury, as secured by
the seventh amendment; neither,—</p>

<p>“1. By an organization of the courts in such a manner
as not to secure it to suitors; nor,</p>

<p>“2. By authorizing the courts to exercise, or their
assumption of, equity or admiralty jurisdiction over
cases at law.”</p>

<p>“This amendment,” says he, “preserves the right
of jury trial against any infringement by any department
of the government.”—<i>Baldwin’s Rep.</i> 404.</p>

<p>Now, what are the tribunals created by the Fugitive
Slave law but a new “organization of the courts”?
or rather, the creation of new courts, “in such a manner
as not to secure, [the right of trial by jury,] to
suitors?” By it, Congress creates tribunals unknown
to the common law, and purports to give them power
over common law rights.</p>

<p>Having now proved, from the nature of the claim
in controversy,—namely, the claim of one man to the
personal services and the liberty of another man, and the
counter claim of personal liberty and of self-ownership,—that
the right in dispute between the claimant of
an alleged fugitive, and the person claimed, is a common
law right; and that <i>any</i> legal process to determine
this right, “whatever form it may assume,” is a
“suit at common law,” it only remains, under this
head, to establish my <i>third</i> point, namely;</p>

<p>A claim to <i>any</i> person, as one “held to service or
labor,” always and necessarily presumes that “the
value in controversy exceeds twenty dollars.”</p>

<p>On this point, direct authority may be found in the
case of <i>Lee</i> vs. <i>Lee</i>, 8 Peters’s Rep. 44. This was
an appealed case, where by law no appeal could be taken
unless “the value in controversy” should be “one
thousand dollars or upwards.” It was objected that<span class="pagenum" id="Page_414">[Pg 414]</span>
the appellants,—the petitioners for freedom,—were
not worth a thousand dollars. But the court said,—</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>“The matter in dispute, in this case, is the freedom of the
petitioners. The judgment of the court below is against their
claim to freedom; the matter in dispute is, therefore, to the
plaintiffs in error, the value of their freedom, <i>and this is not
susceptible of a pecuniary valuation</i>. Had the judgment
been in favor of the petitioners, and the writ of error brought
by the party claiming to be the owner, the value of the slaves
as <i>property</i> would have been the matter in dispute, and affidavits
might be admitted to ascertain such value. But affidavits
estimating the value of freedom are entirely inadmissible,
and no doubt is entertained of the jurisdiction of the court.”</p>
</div>

<p>Suppose there are two claimants for the same alleged
fugitive? If his market value exceeds twenty dollars,
both of them have a clear right to the trial by jury.
And can it be that a man’s right to his own <i>freedom</i> cannot
be tried by a jury, when, if two men dispute about
his <i>value</i>, each may claim the jury trial, and cannot be
denied?</p>

<p>On the three points, then, 1. What constitutes a
common law or “legal right;” 2. What constitutes
“a suit at common law,” and 3. What constitutes
“a value which exceeds twenty dollars,”—namely;
the personal liberty of any human being, though he be
an infant just born, or a drivelling idiot, or he be
stretched upon his death bed with only another hour
to breathe,—I trust I have made out a case which
entitles a party to trial by jury under the constitution
of the United States.</p>

<p>I might here rest the argument, feeling that, from
authority and from reason, from the old and time-honored
principles of the common law, as well as from
those interpretations of the constitution which have
been given by the supreme court, my conclusions are
impregnable. But I proceed to notice some of the
points taken on the other side; and if I shall occasionally<span class="pagenum" id="Page_415">[Pg 415]</span>
advert to positions that are obviously too
shallow and fallacious for discussion, it is only because
I wish to omit nothing which any one may think of
importance.</p>

<hr class="tb">

<p>It is alleged that the whole force of the above
argument, otherwise conclusive, is annulled, because a
slave is no party to the constitution, is not under its
protecting shield any more than a horse or an ox, and
therefore, any provisions, however strong, securing the
jury trial, are inapplicable to him. A slave, it is said,
is not one of the “people” by whom and for whom the
constitution was formed. He is an outlaw, and an
outcast. He has no inherent or inalienable rights
<i>as a man</i>. What he has, he has <i>ex gratia</i>, by the
good will of those who own him, body and soul, and
who are graciously pleased to forego some of their
legal rights from generosity in themselves, and not from
justice to him.</p>

<p>Now, as it seems to me, a most obvious principle
confutes this argument utterly. By the laws of the
free states, we know no such being as a slave. Our
courts, in their functions as state courts, do not understand
the meaning of the word <i>slave</i>. To talk to
them in that capacity about a slave or slavery, is
talking to them in an unknown tongue. In the eye of
the legislators of the free states, and in the eye of the
courts of the free states, so far as their domestic polity
is concerned, there can be no such creature as a slave.
The constitution of every free state in this Union
must be first altered, before any such being as a slave,
or any such condition as slavery, can be recognized
under them, as state authorities.</p>

<p>So the constitution of the United States creates no
slaves, and can create none. Nor has it power to
establish the condition of slavery any where. And I
hold further, that if the government of the United<span class="pagenum" id="Page_416">[Pg 416]</span>
States, by escheat, by purchase, by execution against
a debtor, or in any other way, should become possessed
of a slave, that moment he would be free. The government
of the United States can neither hold a slave,
nor make valid title to a slave by sale. It is a government
whose powers consist of the grants that have
been made to it; and nowhere, by no competent party,
has any such grant ever been made.</p>

<p>The relation of the government of the United
States to slavery consists in this, and in this alone:
that when this government was created, slavery existed
in a portion of the states; and by certain provisions in
the constitution, the existence of this slavery was
recognized, and certain rights and duties in relation to
it were respectively acknowledged and assumed. But
the government of the United States has no more
power to turn a freemen in a free state into a slave
than it has to turn a slave in a slave state into a
freeman.</p>

<p>The officers of the state government being sworn to
support the constitution of the United States, the
governments of the free states are implicated indirectly
in the matter of slavery, as the government of the
United States is directly, and not otherwise.</p>

<p>Both by the constitution of the United States, then,
and by the constitutions of all the free states, every
man found within the limits of a free state is <i>prima
facie</i> <span class="allsmcap">FREE</span>. No matter what complexion he may wear,
or what language he may speak, he is a free man <span class="allsmcap">UNTIL</span>
some other civil condition is proved upon him, or until
he forfeits his freedom by crime. Every man, therefore,
in any one of the free states of this Union, has a
right to stand upon this legal presumption, and to claim
all the privileges and immunities that grow out of it <i>until</i>
his presumed freedom is wrested from him by legal
proof. It is the most cruel of sophisms to say, that
because a man is <i>claimed</i> as a slave, he is not under<span class="pagenum" id="Page_417">[Pg 417]</span>
the protection of the constitution, and then <i>to prescribe
a base mode of trial for him, by which he can be proved
the thing he is claimed for</i>. On the subject of freedom
or slavery, we of the free states know of but one class
of men living among us. That class is free. There
is no such class as slaves known to our laws. Nor is
there any intermediate class, who may be presumed to
be slaves on account of their color, or who may be
proved to be slaves by less evidence, or by an inferior
kind of evidence, because of color.</p>

<p>No axiom is more universal or indisputable, than
that the right to freedom in a free state, and the right
to be held and treated by the courts as a freeman, has
no relation to complexion. If, then, these rights have
no relation to complexion, <i>all</i> white men may be arbitrarily
presumed to be slaves, and be deprived of the
form of trial, secured to them by the constitution, just
as well as any colored man can be. The former may
just as well be proved to be slaves, on dangerous, or on
inferior, or on insufficient evidence, as the latter. No;
the liberty to which every man, of whatever color, in
a free state, is <i>prima facie</i> entitled, invests him with
its protection, and this investiture cannot be stripped
from him but by the judgment of his peers or the law
of the land,—which, as we have before seen, means
trial by jury.</p>

<p>Any other interpretation assumes this as a postulate,
namely, that there is a higher or surer kind of trial
applicable to freemen, and a lower or inferior mode of
proceeding applicable to slaves. And the inhuman inference
from this assumption is, that any man against
whom a ten-dollar commissioner may issue a warrant
as a possible slave, shall forthwith be subjected to the
slave’s mode of trial, and be utterly deprived of the
freeman’s mode of trial; or, at the best, that he shall
be sent away a thousand miles, into another jurisdiction,
there only to have the slave’s mode of trial. According<span class="pagenum" id="Page_418">[Pg 418]</span>
to this form of proceeding, the first thing
which the commissioner says to his victim is, “Being
a slave, you must be tried in a summary manner.”
“But I am not a slave,” asseverates the respondent,
“and I claim to be tried by my peers under the guaranties
of the constitution.” “You are no party to the
constitution,” rejoins the commissioner, “and, therefore,
not entitled to its shelter. The constitution was
made by the people, and for the people, and you are
not of them.” Then says the victim, “If I could
have the trial due to a freeman, I could prove myself
a freeman; but under the form of trial awarded to a
slave, I may be adjudged a slave; so that my fate is
made to depend not upon my rights, but upon your
form of proceeding.” “Even if so,” retorts the mercenary
minister of the law, “it is but an imperfection
incident to human institutions. Is not one man’s
property sometimes taken to pay another man’s debts?
and is not one man sometimes executed for another
man’s murder? Why, then, should the courts of
justice be arraigned, if a freeman, instead of a slave, is
sometimes consigned to bondage?”</p>

<p>Sir, the unmistakable distinction lies here; that if
there be any difference between the kind or degree of
proof applicable to a freeman and that applicable to a
slave, then, in a free state, you must first prove a man to
be a slave by freeman’s proof. If cast on such proof,
then, and not till then, does he become the subject of
slave proof. Any thing else under the form of justice
is a mockery of justice. No man will say that the
“claim” imposes any disability upon the person
claimed, or takes away from him any rights. A man
who has a presumptive right to his liberty, has a perfect
right to all the means to prove it. The “claim”
imposes no obligation to deliver up, but the proof
under the claim; and this proof in a case of “life,
liberty, or property,” is to be judged of by a jury.<span class="pagenum" id="Page_419">[Pg 419]</span>
The real question is, <i>who</i> is to be delivered up, a slave
or a freeman? If the person arrested is prejudged to
be a slave, then there is no need of a trial at all. If
he is <i>prima facie</i> a freeman, then he is entitled to the
most perfect mode of trial.</p>

<p>By the theory, I believe, of all the slave states but
one, every person of maternal African descent is presumed
to be a slave. As such, his civil condition is
fixed, special tribunals are constituted to try him, and
he is subjected to rules of evidence unknown to the
common law and never applied to freemen. Now it
would be but the same kind of legal absurdity and
preposterousness, for the presumptive slave in a slave
state, to demand the form of trial, the tribunal, and the
evidence, which there appertain to a freeman, as it is
to subject the presumptive freeman in a free state, to
the form of trial, the tribunal, and the evidence, which
appertain to a slave.</p>

<p>The iniquity of the law is, that it enables a perjured
or fictitious slave owner, on proofs most easily
fabricated, to seize any individual in a free state, and
to <i>prejudge</i> him to be a slave, by the very form of
trial which this law authorizes. On the contrary,
nothing can be more clear, than that the civil condition
or <i>status</i> of every man found in a free state is that
of a free man. His living under a free constitution,
without any thing more, invests him <i>prima facie</i> with
this character. Until divested of this character, he
continues presumptively a free man. While such, he
is entitled to every security which the constitution
gives to a free man. How then can he be subjected
to a trial which reverses the whole law of presumption
in favor of freedom, and which presumes that he is
a slave to begin with? This is not only anticipating
the judgment at the commencement of the proceedings,
but it is anticipating the worst judgment that
can be passed; and, by anticipating, procuring it; as
prophecies often procure their own fulfilment.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_420">[Pg 420]</span></p>

<p>I put this case, and I challenge an answer that shall
refute or admit my conclusion: If any one man in a
free state can be seized and suddenly transported into
bondage under this law, <i>then every other man also
can be; and there is not a single person left in any
free state who has a right to a trial by jury to save
him from slavery</i>. I am not now speaking of the
special danger to each particular individual, but of the
principle that embraces us all. Under the most oppressive
of tyrannies there are persons who are not in
danger. But under such a law as this, who can tell
what may happen to men arrested away from home,
to unprotected women, and to helpless children? Do
you say that a public sentiment and a public watchfulness
exist, which would protect the whites, the female,
and the child? I reply, that we possess our right to
protection under the constitution and laws, and are
not to be turned over to public sentiment or public
watchfulness in order to enjoy it.</p>

<p>Suppose an analogous law to be passed respecting
debtor and creditor. Suppose a law to provide some
new mode of proceeding by which the indebtedness
of a defendant should be so far presumed as to subject
him to an inferior kind of defence, or to transfer his
case to another kind of tribunal, as from jurors to
arbitrators, to be selected by the plaintiff himself.
Who is there, though through all his life he had fulfilled
the apostolic injunction to “owe no man any
thing,” that might not be cast in an action that would
strip him of all his fortune?</p>

<p>The law punishes murder by death. Could it know
with omniscient certainty, beforehand, <i>who is a murderer</i>,
it might take from him the trial by jury without
offence to the eternal principles of justice. It is because
the law cannot know with infallible certainty,
beforehand, who is a murderer, that it provides the
trial by jury to determine the question. Just so,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_421">[Pg 421]</span>
because human tribunals cannot know with certainty
who is a slave and who is free, the constitution gives
the trial by jury, before any man in a free state shall
be deprived of his freedom. And the argument, that
if a man be wrongfully consigned to bondage he may
be afterwards restored to freedom, is as audacious and
as tyrannical as to say that an innocent man may be
hanged and sent into another world as a felon, because
sometimes the dead have been restored to life.</p>

<p>It is no answer to this view of the case, to say that
all processes, whether civil or criminal, are initiated
on the supposition that a pecuniary liability exists, or
that a wrong has been done. Every body knows that
no presumption of this kind follows the plaintiff, or
the government, into court. When there, in the presence
of the law, the plaintiff must establish his claim
affirmatively. The possible debtor is no longer a
debtor. So the government must prove the guilt of
the man it has arraigned. The possible criminal is
no longer a criminal. In the eye of the law, he is as
innocent as the unborn child. When they claim the
trial by jury, neither plaintiff nor prosecutor can say,
You are not entitled to this form of trial, because
you <i>are</i> presumptively a debtor, or presumptively
an offender. Yet this is precisely, and <i>in totidem
verbis</i>, what the pro-slavery argument says to the
respondent when he is brought before the commissioner
and put in peril of his freedom. In both the
cases supposed, such a doctrine would take away a
man’s rights in the most odious manner, by taking
away the legitimate and constitutional means of defending
them.</p>

<p>For the purpose of determining by suit or by prosecution
whether a man is a debtor or is an offender, a
suit or a prosecution may be commenced against him,
but never for the purpose of raising a presumption that
he is either the one or the other, or to deprive him of<span class="pagenum" id="Page_422">[Pg 422]</span>
any evidence to which an unindebted or an innocent
man is entitled, or to change the tribunal which is to
try the question of indebtedness or of guilt. If attachment
on mesne process, if even indictment by the
grand inquest for the county, does not deprive a man
of his right to a trial by jury, how can so great a natural
wrong be constitutionally inflicted by the warrant
of a commissioner?</p>

<p>The presumption that a colored man is a free man
in the free states, is just as strong as that a man of
pure, unmixed, Anglo-Saxon blood is a free man in the
slave states; and would they tolerate the doctrine for
a moment that any perfectly pure-blooded white person
could be transformed into a slave, and as such sent
from his own state into another, under this law? Nay
more; would any slave claimant at the south be
allowed to go <i>into a slave state</i>, and seize upon a
pretended fugitive whom another man might claim to
own, under such a process as is now sufficient, <i>in a
free state</i>, to authorize the taking and carrying away
of the same individual?</p>

<p>But to the argument, that the constitution and the
law of 1850 apply only to slaves, and that because
slaves are not parties to the constitution they are not
under its protection, and so not included in the provision
for jury trial, there is another answer perfectly
fatal. It is this: the constitution does not enumerate
the various classes of criminals who shall be entitled
to trial by jury; but with the exception of cases of
impeachment, and cases in the military and naval service,
it expressly declares as follows: “The trial of
all crimes shall be by jury.” And also, “In all criminal
prosecutions, the accused shall enjoy the right to
a speedy and public trial by an impartial jury,” &amp;c.
The right, therefore, is not made to depend upon the
<i>classes of persons</i> on trial, but upon the nature of the
charge brought against them. The constitution does<span class="pagenum" id="Page_423">[Pg 423]</span>
not say that freemen shall be tried in one way and
slaves in another; but its language is, “all crimes,”
and “all criminal prosecutions;” so that it embraces
every person <i>who is prosecuted</i>, whether free or slave,
citizen or foreigner, Jew or Gentile. If an Englishman
or a Frenchman were to be tried here for murder, how
would the whole world deride the suggestion that he
should not have a jury trial because he is a foreigner,—because
he is not one of the “people,” and so not
a party to the constitution!</p>

<p>So the constitution does not say, in suits between
merchant and merchant, or between landlord and tenant,
and so forth, “the right of trial by jury shall be
preserved;” but it says, “<i>In suits at common law</i>,
where the value in controversy shall exceed twenty
dollars.” The right is not determined by the character
of the litigants, but by the nature of the action.
The constitution does not care who the parties are,—man,
woman, bond or free,—it is all the same. As
soon as parties appear upon the record, the right to
trial by jury attaches. The <i>suit</i>, and not the <i>civil
condition</i> of the litigants who instituted or who defend
it, tests and determines the jury question.</p>

<p>In the case of <i>Lee</i> vs. <i>Lee</i>, before cited, the law
allowed an appeal only in case the sum in controversy
should amount to one thousand dollars. The appellant
was of African descent, and therefore, within that
jurisdiction, presumptively a slave; not presumptively
a freeman, as every man is in a free state; and, if a
slave, then he could own no property; for, by the cruel
law of slavery, every master may rob his slave legally
of all that he earns, or finds, or otherwise receives.
Yet the supreme court sustained the appeal. Why
was not so astute an exception as this then taken?—an
exception which, if they have a bar in Pandemonium,
would have done honor to one of its counsellors.
Why was it not said that a slave was no party to the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_424">[Pg 424]</span>
law, and therefore not entitled to its benefits? No
reason can be assigned why a slave is not as much
under the protection of a constitution made for the
“people,” as under the protection of a law made for
the “people.” Yet here, even in the case of a presumptive
slave, a right was acknowledged, which
some freemen, in free states, deny to presumptive
freemen.</p>

<p>I have here been combating the argument, that
because the Fugitive Slave law is aimed at slaves, no
freeman has any ground of complaint against it, even
though he should be converted into a chattel under it.
He must console himself under the doom of interminable
bondage, with the patriotic and pious reflection
that he is only suffering, as an exception, to prove the
general excellence of the law; and he must leave this
consolation also to his enslaved children. For, in his
case, it is said that eternal slavery is only one of those
exceptions in the working of the law which proves
the rule of its general excellence. This argument I
hold to be eminently sophistical and cruelly oppressive.
But if any one believes it to be a sound argument,
then I hold him to all fair deductions resulting from
it,—of which the following is clearly one:—</p>

<p>On the same ground on which Congress passes a
law for escaped slaves, let every free state pass a law
for resident freemen. The presumption in every free
state being, that all men within its borders are free,
let every such state give the trial by jury, in all cases
in which personal liberty is involved, to every one
who shall ask for it, and who has not once had it in a
litigation with the same party, on the same subject-matter.
According to the argument I have been considering,
no slaveholder can complain of such a law;
for, by its very terms, it applies only to freemen. The
law of Congress applying only to slaves, and the supposed
state law applying only to freemen, there is no<span class="pagenum" id="Page_425">[Pg 425]</span>
conflict between them. And if, by accident or mistake,
any real slave should take shelter under such a
state law, and should escape a life of horrible bondage,
it will be only one of those mistakes which may arise
under the purest administration of justice. It will
answer quite as well as its counterpart case, to stand
as one of those exceptions in the working of a rule
which prove its general excellence. If the occasional
subjection of a freeman instead of a slave, to all the
horrors of bondage, constitutes no valid objection to
the United States law, then, surely, the occasional
enfranchisement of a slave from a bondage that was
always unjust and cruel, should constitute no objection
to the law of the free state. If this Fugitive Slave
law continues for a single year, I hope every free
state will pass a law inflicting condign punishment
upon every man who directly or indirectly assists in
sending any man into southern bondage, unless he can
prove before a jury that the man so sent was a slave.</p>

<p>So far, I have considered the question, whether a
fair interpretation of the constitution does not secure
the jury trial in every free state, to an alleged fugitive,
and empower him to demand it as a matter of right.</p>

<p>But this is a strange question to discuss in a republican
government. The proper question is, not
whether the constitution expressly <i>demands</i> the jury
trial, but whether it will, by any fair implication, <i>allow</i>
it. The only point which a republican judge or citizen
can, with decency, make on this subject is, Does
the constitution forbid, prohibit, deny, such trial?—for,
if it does not, then the jury should be granted of
course. In a free country, under a free government,
where the idea has become traditional, where the doctrine
has become a household doctrine, that the trial
by jury is the palladium of our civil and religious liberties,
is it not amazing that we should find men who
seem eager to avoid this form of trial, rather than<span class="pagenum" id="Page_426">[Pg 426]</span>
zealous to grasp it? It is the saddest of spectacles;
it argues the most mournful degeneracy, to see the
children at this early day, from grovelling notions of
ambition and of wealth, abandoning those noble principles
of freedom for which their fathers so lately
shed their blood. Wherever the constitution allows
the trial by jury, in a matter of human liberty, in
Heaven’s name let us have it. Let Russia and Austria
curtail and deny this privilege of freemen; let the
tyrant, and the tyrant’s minions among ourselves,
explore the musty records of darker times, to find
precedents against it; let them strive, by their shallow
sophistries and plausibilities, to gloss over this ravishing
of liberty and life from beings created in the
image of God; but let every true republican, whenever,
in the disposal of these momentous interests, the
constitution will, by fair construction, sanction it, cling
to the trial by jury, as to the only plank that will save
him,—ay, the only one that will save the human
race,—from being again ingulfed in the vortex of
despotism. The enemy of the trial by jury, wherever
human liberty is concerned, is the enemy of human
liberty and of the human race. The friends of a
repeal of this law, then, need not discuss the question
whether the constitution does expressly confer the
right of trial by jury upon the alleged fugitive, for it is
enough for them if the constitution does not take it
away.</p>

<p>It is worthy of remark, that in both of the bankrupt
laws passed by the United States, it was expressly
provided, that when the commissioners should declare
any person to be a bankrupt, he should have the right
to a trial by jury to annul their decision. Thus, when
the law proposed, not to appropriate a man’s property,
but merely to enable his creditors to receive it in payment
of their debts, the jury trial was secured to him;
but here, where the direct purpose is to strip a man<span class="pagenum" id="Page_427">[Pg 427]</span>
of his liberty, and of his property in himself, the jury
trial is denied.</p>

<p>This seems an appropriate place to consider the further
irrelevant suggestion, sometimes obtruded, namely,
that an alleged fugitive is not deprived of a trial by
jury, because he may have it in the state to which he
is carried.</p>

<p>Here the pro-slavery advocate admits, at least for argument’s
sake, that the alleged fugitive has a right, at
some time, and some where, to the jury trial. If so,
then there are numerous and powerful reasons why
this trial should be had in the state in which he is
found, rather than in that to which he may be transported.
I will advert to a few of these reasons.</p>

<p>1. Slaves are held to be personal property. Trover
lies for their value where they have been unlawfully
converted. Trespass is the remedy for an injury done
to them. According to the laws of all the slave states,
they are the subject of larceny. Suits to recover them,
or to recover damages for an injury done to them, are
personal actions; and in personal actions it is required,
by all the precedents and all the analogies of the common
law, that the action should be tried in the jurisdiction
where the writ is served. By the common law,
personal actions are transitory. They are to be brought
where the defendant resides; or, at least, where the
property which is claimed lies. In the case of an
alleged slave, both the defendant and the property are
where <i>he</i> is found. According to the usages and principles
of the common law, therefore, the trial should
be there.</p>

<p>2. Before trial and judgment, the parties are like
any other parties before the court, or they should be
so. The claimant stands upon the merits of his claim;
the respondent upon those of his defence. It may be
inconvenient for a Texan claimant to prove his right
to an alleged fugitive in Massachusetts; but it will be<span class="pagenum" id="Page_428">[Pg 428]</span>
indefinitely more inconvenient for a citizen of Massachusetts
to prove his freedom in Texas. If the trial is
in Massachusetts, and the plaintiff prevails, he takes
immediate possession of his slave, and is invested at
once with all the rights which the rigors of the slave
law so abundantly give. But if the trial is in Texas,
whither the defendant has been forcibly exiled, and
there <i>he</i> prevails, who is to reimburse or recompense
him for his intermediate bondage; for being dragged
from his home; torn from wife, children, and friends;
for being plunged, perhaps for years, into the hell of
slavery itself, with all the untold agonies of an apprehended
slavery for life?</p>

<p>What Judge Story says respecting the right of all
persons who are accused of crime to be tried by a
“jury of the state and district wherein the crime shall
have been committed,” applies with full force to a
trial for liberty. “The object of this clause,” says he,
“is to secure the party accused from <i>being dragged to
trial in some distant state</i>, away from his friends, and
witnesses, and neighborhood.” “Besides this,” he
continues, “a trial in a distant state or territory might
subject the party to the most oppressive expenses, or
perhaps even to the inability of procuring the proper
witnesses to establish his innocence.” (3 <i>Com</i>. 654.)
For “innocence” read <i>liberty</i>, and the argument in
behalf of the alleged criminal becomes applicable to
the alleged fugitive. And why should the alleged
fugitive be treated less mercifully than the alleged
felon? The law is unspeakably rigorous in the case
of an alleged fugitive, but softens into mercy over an
alleged pirate or murderer.</p>

<p>If the trial, then, is where all the practice and principles
of the common law indicate that it should be,
no great or irreparable injury is done; no inconvenience
even is suffered beyond that which is always suffered
in enforcing a claim in a foreign and distant jurisdiction.<span class="pagenum" id="Page_429">[Pg 429]</span>
But if a freemen is carried away, a grievous and
intolerable wrong is done; a wound is inflicted which
mortal medicaments cannot heal, nor the longest continued
punishment of the malefactor ever expiate.</p>

<p>3. By transferring the trial to the place of the claimant’s
domicile, an effective, and, as it seems to me, a
most iniquitous advantage is given him, in regard to
evidence, while the respondent is subjected to cruel
disabilities. By the laws of all but one or two of the
slave states, persons of African descent, whether slave
or free, are declared incompetent witnesses against
white men. The freeman, then, by being removed as
a fugitive into a slave state, may lose his evidence,
which, under such circumstances, is the loss of his
liberty. This violation, therefore, of the principles of
the common law, in regard to the place of trial, is, to
him, of the most momentous consequence. It is not
true, then, in any just sense, that the trial by jury is
still “preserved” to the alleged fugitive, notwithstanding
his removal to a slave state. The common law
trial, as inclusive of the right to adduce common law
evidence, is not “preserved.”</p>

<p>4. But not only is the evidence different, but, in
some of the slave states, <i>the law itself is different</i>; so
that one man may carry another by force into a jurisdiction
where the law will account him a slave, when,
had he been tried where he was found, the law would
declare him free,—the facts in both cases being the
same.</p>

<p>Take the law of Kentucky, for instance,—and I
refer to this state because its slave code is of a milder
type than that of most of the Southern States, its
dreadful rigors being mitigated by an infusion of more
humanity.</p>

<p>By the laws of Kentucky, a master may carry a slave
<i>in transitu</i>, through a free state, or he may allow his
slave to go temporarily into a free state, without a<span class="pagenum" id="Page_430">[Pg 430]</span>
forfeiture of the legal right to hold him. <i>Graham</i> vs.
<i>Strader &amp; Gorman</i>, 5 Ben. Munroe, 173, (1844;)
<i>Davis</i> vs. <i>Tingle et al.</i>, 8 Ben. Munroe, 545, (1848;)
<i>Collins</i> vs. <i>America</i>, 9 Ben. Munroe, 565, (1849;)
<i>Bushe’s Reps.</i> vs. <i>White</i>, 3 Munroe, 104; <i>Rankin</i> vs.
<i>Lydia</i>, 2 A. K. Marshall, 468, (1820.)</p>

<p>In Massachusetts certainly, and I suppose in most of
the Northern States, all such cases would be decided
in favor of the respondent.<a id="FNanchor_20" href="#Footnote_20" class="fnanchor">[20]</a></p>

<p>Now, what greater outrage can be inflicted upon a
man than to seize, and bind, and carry him into a foreign
jurisdiction, where not only is the evidence different,
by which his rights may be proved, but where
the law also is different, by which his rights are to
be adjudicated. In Holland, the killing of a stork
once was, if it be not now, punishable with death;
because this bird devours the animals that would
otherwise bore through and undermine its ocean-barring
dikes. In a neighboring country, the killing
of a stork may not be merely blameless, but praiseworthy.
What an atrocity it would be to seize a
man in the latter country, and carry him to Holland
to be tried and executed for doing an act which, according
to the law of the place where he had a right
to be tried, may have been not only innocent, but
laudable! I leave you, sir, to make the application.</p>

<p>5. But what must shock every man who possesses
any just appreciation of the value of human liberty,
or has any just perception of the principles on which
it is founded, is, that under the Fugitive Slave law,
the plaintiff gets possession and control not only of the
chattel or article of property claimed, but of the defendant
himself. He gets command, not only of the
thing in litigation, but of the body and soul of the
litigant. A Boston or New York merchant would consider<span class="pagenum" id="Page_431">[Pg 431]</span>
it a grievous hardship, if a southern adventurer
could go there and seize upon all his property, transport
it to Mobile, or New Orleans, and compel the
owner to follow it and try title to it, in the place of
the captor’s domicile. Still more grievous would the
hardship become, if, under the new jurisdiction, the
defendant might be deprived of the evidence which,
at home, would be decisive of his rights, or find himself
controlled by adverse laws which he never had
helped to frame. But what an extreme of barbarous
tyranny would it be, if, beyond all these enormities,
the southern plaintiff could seize him too,—the defendant
himself,—the alleged debtor,—and grasp
him in his own iron hand, obtaining supreme control
over his body by force, and over his mind by fear;
could command his powers of locomotion, so that he
could go only where the will of his master would permit;
could control his speech and his vision, so that he
could consult with no counsel, and could see no friend
but such as were in his master’s pay; and, to enforce
his authority, could imprison him, and starve him, and
scourge him, and mutilate him, if he but so much as
uttered a whisper that he had a right to have a trial by
his country, or opened his lips in prayer to God to
break the fetters of his iniquitous bondage!</p>

<p>To tamper with the witnesses of the adverse party,
or endeavor to suborn his counsel to violate their duty
to their client, is not only an act of the grossest baseness,
but would subject the offender to penal retribution.
Yet what need would there ever be of corrupting
witnesses or suborning counsel, if a party could
get bodily possession and absolute control of his antagonist
himself?</p>

<p>Does not every one see that, in ninety-nine cases in
a hundred, a control over the defendant’s person and
will would be a control over his case? His rights
would be lost in his enforced disability to defend them.<span class="pagenum" id="Page_432">[Pg 432]</span>
You might as well put out a man’s eyes, and then talk
of his right in the common sunlight. In Baltimore,
or Louisville, a kidnapped freeman might find an opportunity
of self-redemption; but such a captive will
never be carried to Baltimore or Louisville. He will
be sent to some interior region, perhaps fifty miles from
any court, or the residence of any counsel, where he
may never have an opportunity to speak to a white
man unless it be to a taskmaster, who is paid to guard
and to silence him.</p>

<p>The authors of the Federalist deemed the principle
of excluding an interested party from all power of
deciding his own cause to be so important, that they
laid down the following doctrine: “No man ought
certainly to be a judge in his own cause, or in any
cause, in respect to which he has the least interest or
bias.” (No. 80.) Yet the only chance which the
Fugitive Slave law allows to a freeman, when carried
into bondage, is that which he may exercise while
under the absolute control of his robber master.</p>

<p>But more than this: the law imposes no obligation
upon the claimant to carry his victim to the state he
is charged to have escaped from. A man charged to
have escaped from Texas may be carried to Florida.
Nay, he may not be carried to any state in this Union;
but may be sent to Cuba or Brazil; beyond hope, and
into the outer darkness of despair.</p>

<p>All the arguments which I have ever heard, or seen,
on this point, gratuitously <i>assume</i>, that the persons
reclaimed and transported will have an honest master,
be surrounded by kind friends, and have a lawyer at
hand whom they can consult with every day, and money
in their pockets to fee him. Would such be the case of
a kidnapped freeman? Would a wretch, vile enough
to rob a man of his liberty, carry him five hundred or
a thousand miles, and then go to a shire town during
a session of the court, and give his pretended slave a<span class="pagenum" id="Page_433">[Pg 433]</span>
purse of money with which to fee a lawyer for investigating
his right to freedom? No! the man who
knows, or suspects, that he has seized a freeman, or
that his victim even believes himself to be a freeman,
and will put the claimant to the trouble and expense
of a trial, will plunge that freeman into the abyss of
bondage, where no ray of hope may ever reach him,
and where his voice will be hushed as in the silence
of death.</p>

<p>Another objection to the Fugitive Slave law is, that
it confers judicial power upon persons who are not
judges. Here we are not left to inference or construction,
but can stand on the plain words of the constitution.
The third article declares,—</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>“The judicial power of the United States shall be vested
in one supreme court, and in such inferior courts as the Congress
may from time to time ordain and establish. The judges
both of the supreme and inferior courts shall hold their offices
during good behavior, and shall at stated times receive for
their services a compensation which shall not be diminished
during their continuance in office.”—<i>Art.</i> III. § 1.</p>
</div>

<p>Here I hold it to be clear beyond dispute, that the
“judges” mentioned in the second sentence of the
above section are the members of the “supreme court”
and “inferior courts” mentioned in the first section,
and no other. If so, then there can be no doubt about
the tenure of their office, and the mode of their appointment,
compensation, and removal.</p>

<p>By sec. 2, of Art. II., the President “shall nominate,
and by and with the advice and consent of the Senate
shall appoint,” “judges of the supreme court, and all
other officers of the United States, whose appointments
are not herein otherwise provided for, and which
shall be established by law.”</p>

<p>The appointment of <i>no</i> judge of <i>any</i> court is “otherwise
provided for in the constitution;” and therefore<span class="pagenum" id="Page_434">[Pg 434]</span>
the appointment of <i>all</i> the judges in whom “the judicial
power of the United States is vested,” belongs
by the constitution to the President and Senate; and
this “judicial power” cannot be delegated to, nor exercised
by, any persons not so appointed.</p>

<p>The courts may appoint “inferior officers,” such as
clerks, criers, or masters in chancery; but these are not
“judges;” nor would any one of them singly, nor any
number of them associated together, constitute a
“court,” within the meaning of the first section of
the third article. Were such the case, then <i>they</i> might
have power to appoint “inferior officers,” and so on,
by sub-delegation, indefinitely.</p>

<p>The constitution also defines what it means by “judicial
power.” It says, “The judicial power shall
extend to all cases in law and equity arising under this
constitution, the laws of the United States,” &amp;c.</p>

<p>Now, my objection is, that the Fugitive Slave law
requires the creation of a large body of officers who
are not “judges,” but whom it purports to invest with
“judicial powers.”</p>

<p>They are not “judges,” because they are not nominated
by the President and confirmed by the Senate,
as all “judges” must be.</p>

<p>They are not “judges” again, because, if they were,
they must hold their offices “during good behavior.”
But the commissioners may be unmade on the day
they are made. “Judges” can be removed only
by conviction, on impeachment. Commissioners may
be removed by the court that appointed them. Not
the President, nor the Senate, nor both together, can
remove a judge, unless by the initiatory and concurrent
action of the House of Representatives. An “inferior
court” can eject a commissioner without notice.</p>

<p>Even if Congress had declared, by express words,
that the commissioners appointed by the circuit and
district courts should be taken and held to be “judges,”<span class="pagenum" id="Page_435">[Pg 435]</span>
it would not make them so; for Congress cannot delegate
any power to judges to appoint judges, nor
to courts to make courts. If Congress could not do
this by express enactment, how can it do so by implication?</p>

<p>Commissioners are not “judges,” also, because no
person can be a “judge” who is not entitled, “at
stated times, to receive for his services a compensation
which shall not be diminished during his continuance
in office.”</p>

<p>This provision necessitates the conclusion that all
“judges” must be entitled to salaries payable periodically.
These salaries are in no case to depend upon
the <i>amount</i> or the <i>quality</i> of their labors,—far less, if
possible, upon their deciding the cases that are brought
before them for the plaintiff or for the defendant. One
“judge” may have an enviable reputation for talent
and integrity, and thus attract suitors to his court.
Another may be as corrupt as Lord Jeffries, and repel
all honest litigants from him. But, in either case, he
has a right to a compensation which shall not be diminished
during his continuance in office. Each year
gives him a definite, unchanged sum of money.</p>

<p>But the commissioner is paid by fees, and the amount
of his fees depends partly upon the number of cases he
decides, and partly also upon the party in whose favor
he decides. If he decides that a man is free, he receives
five dollars. If he decides that he is a slave, he
receives ten. If the commissioner is acceptable to
slave hunters, suitors multiply. If obnoxious to them,
his docket is bare of a case. He is entitled to his
compensation, not “at stated times,” but on the determination
of each case. His compensation may be
diminished, or it may cease altogether, during his continuance
in office. Each year does not give him any
definite, unchanged sum of money.</p>

<p>The “judge” must be paid by the government, and<span class="pagenum" id="Page_436">[Pg 436]</span>
is independent of all the parties before his court.
The commissioner is never to be paid by the government,
but is wholly dependent for his fees upon
the claimant whose case he tries. The government
guaranties the payment of the “judge,” but it can
never inquire or know whether the commissioner be
paid or not.</p>

<p>By the sixth article of the constitution, all “judicial
officers” must make oath or affirmation that they will
support the constitution. But there is no law requiring
these commissioners to take an oath; and as a
matter of practice, in some parts of the country at least,
it is known that they take no such oath.</p>

<p>Now, by the act, a portion of the “judicial power”
of the United States, the <i>whole</i> of which is, by the
constitution, vested in one “supreme court,” and in
“inferior courts,” is given to the commissioners. The
fourth section says they “shall have concurrent <i>jurisdiction</i>
with the judges of the circuit and district courts
of the United States.” If the power of these courts,
in the premises, is judicial, then the power of the commissioners,
being the same, is judicial.</p>

<p>The attorney-general of the United States, in a written
opinion, given by command of the President, declares
that this power, so given to the commissioners,
is judicial. The following are his words:—</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>“These officers, [the commissioners,] and each of them,
have judicial power, and jurisdiction to hear, examine, and decide
the case.”</p>

<p>“The certificate to be granted to the owner is to be regarded
as the act and judgment of a judicial tribunal having competent
jurisdiction.”</p>

<p>“Congress has constituted a tribunal with exclusive jurisdiction
to determine summarily, and without appeal, who are
fugitives from service. The judgment of the tribunal created
by this act is conclusive upon all tribunals.”</p>
</div>

<p>Such is the opinion of the attorney-general of the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_437">[Pg 437]</span>
United States, given upon the precise point, by order
of the President of the United States.</p>

<p>But the point needed no authority to sustain it. It
results inevitably from the very nature of the power
conferred by the law. The decision of the commissioner
is to be <i>final</i> and <i>conclusive</i>, and the subject-matter
of the decision is liberty and property. The
case cannot be reheard or reëxamined by any judge,
or by any court, of any state, or of the United States.
The decision acts <i>in rem</i> and <i>in personam</i>. It delivers
the property to the claimant, and puts the body of
the defendant into his custody. From that moment,
if the law has any validity, the defendant is the slave
of the plaintiff, by force of a “judicial” decision. The
plaintiff, thenceforth, may control his actions, his
words, his food, his sleep. If he chooses to exercise
his authority in such a way, he can order his victim
to carry him home on his back, and make him bear
the loathsome burden of his person as well as of his
will. Now, to say that the power which effects these
results is not a judicial power, is to do violence to language,
and to commit a fraud upon the inherent nature
of ideas. In no case known to the common law, or
indeed to any other law, is a plaintiff invested with
<i>full</i> rights, except after <i>final</i> judgment.</p>

<p>If, then, this power is a “judicial power,” the constitution
peremptorily forbids that it should be vested
any where but in a “court,” whose “judges” are
nominated, confirmed, sworn, hold office, are paid, and
are removable, according to its requirements. Look at
the constitutional distribution of powers. By the first
article, all legislative power “shall be vested in a Congress.”
By the second article, the “executive power
shall be vested in a President.” And by the third article,
“the judicial power shall be vested” in the courts.
And it was just as competent for Congress to invest
“commissioners” with supreme “executive” or<span class="pagenum" id="Page_438">[Pg 438]</span>
“legislative” power, as to vest them with “judicial”
power.</p>

<p>If, by good fortune, or by miraculous interposition,
a captured freeman should afterwards obtain a hearing
in a court of the state to which he had been carried,
such hearing would, in no sense, be in the nature of a
review of the former case, either by appeal, writ of error,
mandamus, or certiorari. It would be by the institution
of <i>another</i> suit, under <i>another</i> government. The
relation of the parties would be reversed. The respondent
who was kidnapped must be plaintiff, the plaintiff
kidnapper, or some one claiming under him, must be
defendant. Were the various <i>possessory</i> writs known
to the English common law any the less “suits at
common law”? or were the courts that tried them any
the less <i>judicial</i> tribunals, because a <i>writ of right</i> could
be afterwards brought, in which the previous judgments
could not be pleaded in bar, and would be
neither estoppel nor proof of title?</p>

<p>But to avoid the force of this, it has been said, that
the proceedings before the commissioner do not constitute
a “case,” within the meaning of the second section
of the third article, which extends the “judicial
power” of the United States to all “cases” in law and
equity. Instead of being a “case,” it is said to be only
a summary inquiry, designed to operate as a condition
for executive action, in order to accomplish a special
and limited object; like the inquiry, who are rightful
claimants of money held by the government, under a
treaty, and how much belongs to each one. It is also
said, that if a construction so literal is to be put upon
the words “judicial power,” then no master in chancery
could act in behalf of the courts in equity cases;
no commissioner of bankruptcy could be appointed
under a bankrupt law, &amp;c.</p>

<p>In answer to the first position, that the proceedings
for the reclamation of fugitive slaves do not constitute<span class="pagenum" id="Page_439">[Pg 439]</span>
“a case,” we have the most explicit declaration of the
supreme court in more <i>cases</i> than one. In Prigg’s
case, 16 Peters, 616, the court say,—</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>“It is plain, then, that while a claim is made by the owner,
out of possession, for the delivery of a slave, it must be made,
if at all, against some other person; and inasmuch as the right
is a right of property capable of being recognized, and asserted
by proceedings before a court of justice, between parties
adverse to each other, it constitutes, in the strictest sense, a
controversy between the parties, and a <span class="allsmcap">CASE</span>, arising under
the constitution of the United States, within the express delegation
of <span class="allsmcap">JUDICIAL POWER</span> given by that instrument.”</p>

<p>“A <span class="allsmcap">CASE</span> in law or equity consists of the right of the one
party as well as of the other, and may truly be said to arise
under the constitution, or a law of the United States, <i>whenever
its correct decision depends</i> <span class="allsmcap">ON THE CONSTRUCTION OF
EITHER</span>.”—<i>Cohens</i> vs. <i>Virginia</i>, 6 Wheat. 379, (5 Cond.
Rep. 101.)</p>
</div>

<p>Indeed, almost every page of the opinion of the
court, in <i>Cohens</i> vs. <i>Virginia</i>, may be referred to, to
show that they used the word “case” in a sense that
embraces the proceedings for the reclamation of a fugitive
slave. If so, then any tribunal, having jurisdiction
over such a “case,” is vested with a part of the “judicial”
power of the United States.</p>

<p>In defining the word “case,” as it occurs in this
article, Judge Story says,—</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>“It is clear that the judicial department is authorized to exercise
jurisdiction to the full extent of the constitution, laws,
and treaties of the United States, <i>whenever any question respecting
them shall assume such a form that the judicial power
is capable of acting upon it</i>. When it has assumed such a
form, it then becomes a <i>case</i>”—3 <i>Comm.</i> 507.</p>

<p>“A case, then, in the sense of this clause of the constitution,
arises, when some subject touching the constitution, laws,
or treaties of the United States, is submitted to the courts by
a party who asserts his rights in the form prescribed by law.”—<i>Ibid.</i></p>
</div>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_440">[Pg 440]</span></p>

<p>And, as if these definitions were not clear enough,
the learned judge adds,—</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>“Cases arising under the <i>laws</i> of the United States are
such as grow out of the <i>legislation</i> of Congress, within the
scope of their constitutional authority, <i>whether they constitute
the right, or privilege, or claim, or protection, or defence of
the party, in whole or in part, by whom they are asserted</i>.”—3
<i>Comm.</i> 508.</p>
</div>

<p>It seems clear, then, that the proceedings authorized
by the Fugitive Slave law cannot be taken out of the
meaning of the word “cases,” (cases in law and equity,)
in the third article.</p>

<p>There is another clause in the third article, which
embraces these proceedings with equal clearness and
certainty. “The judicial power shall extend to controversies”
“between a state and citizens of another
state.” I suppose it will not be denied that a slave
state may itself own slaves. They may escheat to it,
be taken in execution for debt, &amp;c. Now, a free citizen
of Massachusetts may enter the port of Charleston
as a mariner, be seized, imprisoned, and then sold into
slavery for non-payment of jail fees. The State of
South Carolina may purchase him. He may escape
and return to Massachusetts. South Carolina may
then claim him under this Fugitive Slave law.</p>

<p>In such a condition of things, a “controversy” will
exist between “a state and a citizen of another state.”
The commissioner can take jurisdiction of that case as
well as of any other. And who will be bold enough
to say that a trial and judgment by him, delivering up
the respondent to bondage, would not be the exercise
of “judicial power” in a controversy between “a state
and a citizen of another state”?</p>

<p>The argument, that if the commissioner under the
Fugitive Slave law exercises “judicial power,” then
masters in chancery, commissioners of bankruptcy,
&amp;c., exercise it, is answered by a word.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_441">[Pg 441]</span></p>

<p>Masters in chancery assist the court in preparing
questions for decision, but they decide nothing. Every
act of theirs may be reheard and reëxamined by the
court at the pleasure of either party. They enter up
no judgment; they issue no execution. They may
express the opinion that the plaintiff or defendant is
entitled to recover a certain sum of money, or to hold
the chattel in dispute; but neither of them can touch
it. They are “<i>judges</i>” in no legitimate sense. They
exercise no part of the “judicial power.” The court
may call upon them to state an account between parties,
as it calls upon a clerk to make up the record, or
a servitor to bring a law book, or asks a friend to cast
up the interest on a promissory note. Such are the
functions of a master in chancery, whose acts have no
legal validity until assented to by the parties or sanctioned
by the court.</p>

<p>So with regard to commissioners of bankruptcy.
Every act they were ever authorized to perform derived
all its legal force from the consent of the parties,
or from the verdict of a jury, before whom it had been
contested, or from the judgment of the court,—as
may be seen at a glance, by reference to the acts creating
them.</p>

<p>As to the supposed “judicial power” exercised by
commissioners, under a treaty to determine who are
rightful claimants, and to how much each one is entitled,
it is almost too obvious to remark, that as no
citizen can bring “suit” against the government, the
“judicial power” does not “extend” to such a case,
and the suggestion is puerile.</p>

<p>A word more will close my remarks on this topic.
We have seen that a decision of the commissioner adverse
to the respondent delivers him over into absolute,
unconditional slavery. But the prevalent opinion
is, that a decision in the respondent’s favor is no bar
to a subsequent trial of the same person on a new<span class="pagenum" id="Page_442">[Pg 442]</span>
“claim.” It was actually held in Long’s case, in New
York, where the claimant apprehended that the decision
of the first commissioner would be against him,
that he might abandon proceedings before that tribunal
and resort to another. He did so, and prevailed. That
is, the claimant may select, from among an indefinite
number of irresponsible magistrates, the one whose
ignorance or whose turpitude may promise the best
chances of success. But if, from any cause, he should
apprehend defeat, then, and before the final judgment
is pronounced, he can withdraw his suit and commence
anew before another magistrate, and so throw
the dice of the law again and again, until, by the very
doctrine of chances, he shall ultimately succeed. Such
want of equity between the parties stamps this law as
infamous,—for inequity is iniquity.</p>

<p>An argument in favor of the surrender of alleged
fugitives from service under this law has been derived
from the provision for the surrender of fugitives from
justice. But the difference between the cases is world-wide.
In regard to slaves, the constitution says,—“No
person <span class="allsmcap">HELD</span> to service,” &amp;c.; but in regard to
criminals, its language is, “A person <span class="allsmcap">CHARGED</span>,” &amp;c.</p>

<p>Now, who can avoid perceiving the difference between
the legal force of the words “held” and
“charged”? The obligor in a bond is “<span class="allsmcap">HELD</span> and
firmly bound.” The grantor conveys an estate “to
have and to <span class="allsmcap">HOLD</span>” to the grantee and his heirs and
assigns forever. So a lessee is to “<span class="allsmcap">HOLD</span>” for the
term specified. A man is <span class="allsmcap">HELD</span> to answer a charge,
&amp;c., &amp;c. In all these cases the word “<i>hold</i>” implies
a perfect obligation or certain liability. But a man is
“<span class="allsmcap">CHARGED</span>” with an offence when a grand jury has
found an indictment against him, or when a competent
person has made the requisite oath. It is not enough
that a man be <i>charged</i> to be <i>held</i> to service. He must
be <i>proved</i> to be <i>held</i>, or he remains free; the court<span class="pagenum" id="Page_443">[Pg 443]</span>
must know that he is so <i>held</i> before they are authorized
to surrender him. And how, under our constitution,
can the court know such facts as convert a presumptive
freeman into a slave without a trial by jury?</p>

<p>Had the constitution said a fugitive <i>guilty</i> of murder,
&amp;c., shall be delivered up, could a man be delivered
up until <i>proved</i> guilty of murder? Yet the word
<i>guilty</i> is no stronger in reference to a fugitive from justice
than is the word <i>held</i> in reference to a fugitive
from service.</p>

<p>Another distinction between the cases is not less
marked than the preceding. When the fugitive from
justice is <i>claimed</i>, he is claimed by a <i>state</i> for having
violated its law, and when he is delivered up he is delivered
into the custody of the law. Legal process
must have been commenced against him in the state
from which he fled. He is returned, that the prosecution
thus commenced may be completed. He is delivered
from an officer of the law in one state to the
officer of the law in another state. He is transferred,
not to avoid a trial, but to have one. The original indictment
or <i>charge</i>, the arrest in a foreign state, and
the delivery and transportation to the place of trial, are
but separate parts of one legal proceeding. The shield
of the law is continued over him. All the time and all
the way, he has the solemn pledge of the government,
that if not found guilty on the prosecution <i>then pending</i>,
he shall be discharged.</p>

<p>But the alleged slave is claimed not by a state, but
by an individual, and he is delivered up, not into the
custody of the law, where his right might be adjudicated
upon, but into private hands; not into the hands
of a neutral or indifferent person even, but into the
hands of a party interested to deprive him of all his
rights, and who himself claims to be judge, jury, and
all the witnesses, in determining what those rights are.
If he be not a slave, then he is delivered into the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_444">[Pg 444]</span>
hands of a man-stealer. The shield of the law is not
continued over him; nay, the Fugitive Slave act expressly
provides that, whatever his rights may be, yet,
while <i>in transitu</i>, the law shall not recognize them.
The certificate given by the commissioner to the claimant
is to prevent “all molestation of him by any process
issued by the court, judge, magistrate, or other
person whomsoever.” Under this practical interpretation
of our constitution, which, as its own preamble
declares, was formed to “establish justice, and secure
the blessings of liberty,” it takes better care of felons
than of freemen.</p>

<p>But there are other provisions of the constitution
respecting the trial of <i>criminals</i>, which would control
this provision respecting the delivery of fugitives from
justice, even if there should be any doubts about its
true construction. By the constitution as originally
adopted, and by the fifth amendment, all crimes, (except
in cases of impeachment, or in the land and naval
forces,) are to be tried in the state and district where
committed. This makes it impossible to try a fugitive
from justice in the state to which he has fled. It is an
express prohibition against trying him there. But no
such prohibition exists, no analogous provision exists,
respecting the trial of “suits at common law,” or the
trial of “cases” or “controversies,” in which a man
may be deprived of “life, liberty, or property.”
These cases, therefore, not being taken out of the
general provisions of the constitution for securing the
rights of the citizen, are left within it, and hence must
be tried by a jury in the place where the claim is made.</p>

<p>My next objection to this law is, that it attempts to
suspend the writ of <i>habeas corpus</i>.</p>

<p>The constitution says, “The privilege of the writ of
<i>habeas corpus</i> shall not be suspended, unless when, in
cases of rebellion or invasion, the public safety may
require it.” The Fugitive Slave law declares that the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_445">[Pg 445]</span>
“certificate” given to the claimant, his agent or attorney,
“shall prevent all molestation of said person or
persons by any process issued by any court, judge,
magistrate, or other person whomsoever.” Now, as a
writ of <i>habeas corpus</i> is a “process issued by a court
or judge,” it follows, that, according to the terms of the
Fugitive Slave law, the slave owner is not to be “<i>molested</i>”
by that process. What, then, will constitute a
“molestation” of him under this law? Would the
service of a writ of <i>habeas corpus</i> upon him, and, in
case of his refusal voluntarily to obey it, the seizure
of his person, and the carrying of him bodily before
the court, perhaps a hundred miles out of his way;—would
the moral necessity of employing counsel, and
being otherwise subjected to great expense, both of
money and time;—would any or all of these impediments
and privations amount to what this law denominates
“molestation”? If they would, then the slave
owner is exempted from them. And if so exempted
from them, is not the privilege of the writ of <i>habeas
corpus</i> “suspended,” as to his pretended slave? What
else can a “suspension” of it mean?</p>

<p>But take the other alternative. Suppose the writ
of <i>habeas corpus</i> to be issued, and a return of all the
facts by which the supposed slave is held to be made.
The very return brings the Fugitive Slave act before the
court; and if the act is before the court, then, surely,
the question is also before the court, whether it is constitutional
or not. For, if unconstitutional, it is no
law, and no justification of the restraint. Suppose the
court to decide the act to be unconstitutional, and to
discharge the prisoner. This surely would be a “molestation”
of him, in the strongest sense of the word.
To say the least of it, then, the law contains an insolent
and audacious provision, forbidding the “courts,
judges, magistrates, and all other persons whomsoever,”
to do what it may be their sworn constitutional<span class="pagenum" id="Page_446">[Pg 446]</span>
duty to do,—that is, to inquire into the constitutionality
of the law, and, if found to be unconstitutional,
to disregard it.</p>

<p>I am aware of the astute reasoning of the present
able attorney-general of the United States. He says,
first, that the act does not suspend the writ of <i>habeas
corpus</i>, because such suspension would be “a plain
and palpable violation of the constitution, and no intention
to commit such a violation of the constitution
ought to be imputed” to Congress; and second, that if
the certificate of the commissioner is shown “upon the
application of the fugitive for a writ of <i>habeas corpus</i>,
it prevents the issuing of the writ; if upon the return,
it discharges the writ, and restores or maintains the
custody.”</p>

<p>The first reason might be more briefly stated thus:
it don’t because it don’t; or it don’t because it can’t.</p>

<p>The second is as little satisfactory as the first. If the
facts are shown, it says, upon the fugitive’s application
for a writ, no writ will issue; if shown upon the
return of the writ, it will be abated. Is it not most
clear that this assumes the very question in dispute,
whether the law on which the certificate is founded be
constitutional or not? The statement may be all very
true, if the law be constitutional; but suppose the law
to be unconstitutional, would not the statement be superlatively
absurd? Yet whether the law be constitutional
or not, is the very question to be determined.</p>

<p>Let me test the soundness of this logic by a supposed
case. There is, at the present time, a set of politicians
amongst us, who are so alarmed at agitation that each
one of them is a kind of Peter the Hermit, getting up
a crusade to prevent it. Now, suppose Congress, “<i>as
a peace measure</i>,” should pass a law authorizing the
secretary of state to issue his warrant for the arrest and
imprisonment, until the 4th day of March, 1853, or at
least until after the next presidential nominations are<span class="pagenum" id="Page_447">[Pg 447]</span>
made, of any person who shall be guilty of agitating
<i>on the wrong side of said peace measure</i>, and should
further declare that any jailer having such warrant from
said secretary should be free from “all molestation by
any process issued by any court, magistrate, or other
person whomsoever.” Would it be a sound, judicial,
and lawyer-like argument, in such a case, to say that
Congress could not, and could not have intended to,
violate the constitution, and therefore they had not
violated it; and that if the warrant for commitment
should appear upon the prisoner’s application for a writ
of <i>habeas corpus</i>, it would prevent its issuing; if, upon
its return, it would discharge it?</p>

<p>I think it impossible for any one to show that if the
argument be good in the first case, it would not be
good in the second; and good, indeed, in any case,
however outrageously violating the constitution.</p>

<p>Again: suppose the 18th of September last, when
the Fugitive Slave bill was approved, to have been a
time “of rebellion or invasion,” when the public safety
required the suspension of this writ, would not such
words as end the sixth section of the act be sufficient
in law to suspend it? The attorney-general seems to
rely upon the fact that the Fugitive Slave law does not
mention the <i>habeas corpus</i>. He cannot surely mean
to say that the privilege of this writ could not be suspended,
unless by name. Even slavery is not mentioned
in the constitution <i>by name</i>. Suppose Congress,
in a time of rebellion or invasion, to say, in regard to
any class of cases which it might choose to specify,
that if one person shall hold another under executive
warrant, such warrant “shall prevent all molestation
of said person or persons by any process issued by any
court, judge, magistrate, or other person whomsoever;”
could any man deny that such words would have ample
force to suspend the privilege of this sacred and time-hallowed
writ?</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_448">[Pg 448]</span></p>

<p>No! Heaven, and not the thirty-first Congress, be
praised for it! Though this infamous Fugitive law
<i>could not</i> suspend the <i>habeas corpus</i>, yet its words are
adequate to do so. They purport to put the professional
slave-hunter, as it regards the privilege from arrest,
or “molestation,” on the footing of a member of Congress;
and it would not have gone one iota further, in
point of principle, had they made his person inviolable
while going to seize his prey, and when returning
with it.</p>

<p>If the argument of the attorney-general be sound,
then the whole “privilege of the writ of <i>habeas corpus</i>,”
under any corrupt law that any corrupt Congress
may pass, will consist in the privilege of applying to a
court for the writ, and being refused; or in suing out
the writ, and having it quashed.</p>

<p>By the principles of the English law, the privilege
of the <i>habeas corpus</i> attaches to all, whether bond or
free. The words <i>liber homo</i>, says Lord Coke, extend
to every one of the king’s subjects, “be he ecclesiastical
or temporal, free or <i>bond</i>, man or woman, old or
young, or be he outlawed, excommunicated, or any
other, without exception.”—2 <i>Inst.</i> 55.</p>

<p>I now proceed to lay open for the abhorrence of
mankind other deformities of this most odious law. In
opposing a law, a distinction is to be made between
the courts and the people; between the bench and the
ballot-box. The courts can hear but one objection to
a law. It may be impolitic, unrighteous, atrocious;
but if it be constitutional they must sustain it. But
before the tribunal of the people, a law may be impeached
for any attribute of cruelty, oppression, or
meanness. I denounce the Fugitive Slave law for all
these qualities. In its scornful rejection of all those
common-law principles of evidence which have been
ratified by the wisdom of ages; in the “summary”
and piratical haste of its proceedings, and in the indelible<span class="pagenum" id="Page_449">[Pg 449]</span>
blood with which its judgments are recorded, I
believe it has not a parallel in the modern code of any
civilized people.</p>

<p>Should the courts, hampered by previous decisions,
and habituated to the spectacle and the support of a
cruel institution, pronounce this law to be constitutional,
such a judgment would give new force to every
reason why the people should demand its modification
or repeal. It is not enough that it should be declared
void by the courts as against the fundamental law of
the land; it deserves to be branded by the people as
abhorrent to humanity, to civilization, and to the gospel
of Jesus Christ.</p>

<p>Look at its provisions in regard to evidence. The
proof of three facts dooms the victim: first, that the
person named in the warrant owes the claimant service;
second, that he has escaped; and, third, identity.</p>

<p>Now, according to the law, all these facts may be
proved in the absence of the party to be ruined by
them. The whole case may be established by evidence
taken behind the victim’s back, without notice
to him, without knowledge, or possibility of knowledge,
on his part. A freeman may be suddenly arrested, and
dragged into court, and on certain papers being read
against him, which he never saw nor heard of before,
he may be ordered into the custody of officers, and
hurried to a returnless distance from wife, children, and
friends, reduced to the direst form of bondage the world
ever knew, and at the expense of the very government
which he has been taxed to support, and which in turn
was bound to protect him. I will prove by a reference
to the act itself that these atrocities are among its conspicuous
features.</p>

<p>By the sixth section it is made the duty of the
“court, judge, or commissioner,” “upon satisfactory
proof being made by deposition <i>or affidavit</i>, in writing,”
“or by other satisfactory testimony,” “and with proof,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_450">[Pg 450]</span>
<i>also by affidavit</i>, of the identity of the person whose
service or labor is claimed,” “to make out and deliver
to such claimant a certificate,” &amp;c.</p>

<p>And the tenth section of the act declares that the
transcript of a record “taken in any state or territory,
or in the District of Columbia,” and “produced in any
other state, territory, or district,” and being there
“exhibited to any judge, commissioner, or other officer
authorized to cause persons escaping from service or
labor to be delivered up, shall be held and taken to be
full and <i>conclusive</i> evidence of the fact of escape, and
that the service or labor of the person escaping is due
to the party in said record mentioned.” “And upon
the production of other and further evidence, <i>if necessary</i>,
either oral or <i>by affidavit</i>, of the identity of the
person escaping, he or she shall be delivered up to the
claimant.”</p>

<p>Here, then, is a provision unknown to the common
law of England, or to any colony, or people, or tribe
that ever claimed the common law of England as their
inheritance; unknown even to the star chamber, or
high commission court; unknown in the bloodiest
reigns of the bloodiest tyrants that ever sat upon the
English throne; unknown to those judicial villains
whom Lord Campbell calls “<i>ruffians in ermine</i>”—incorporated
into the code of a republican government.
Evidence, which may consign to slavery a man who is
ostensibly and presumptively free,—free by the laws
of the state where he is, and free every where by the
law of God and humanity,—may be prepared in his
absence, without any notice to him, and by any means
of perjury or subornation of perjury to which guilt may
resort, and this evidence is made legally sufficient to
doom a fellow-being to relentless bondage. Notwithstanding
those remarkable clauses in the constitution
which provide that “in all criminal prosecutions the
accused shall enjoy the right to a <i>speedy</i> and <i>public</i><span class="pagenum" id="Page_451">[Pg 451]</span>
trial,” “be informed of the nature and cause of the
accusation,” “be confronted with the witnesses against
him,” “have compulsory process for obtaining witnesses
in his favor,” “and have the assistance of counsel
for his defence;” yet Judge Story comments upon
them in a spirit of dissatisfaction and sorrow; “for,”
says he, “unless the whole system [of the common
law] is incorporated, <i>and especially the law of evidence</i>,
a corrupt legislature, or a debased and servile people,
may render the whole little more than a solemn
pageantry.” (3 <i>Com.</i> 662.) In speaking of a “corrupt
legislature,” he seems to describe what this Congress
has done in enacting the Fugitive Slave law at
its last session; and, in speaking of a “debased and
servile people,” he speaks of just such a people as the
advocates and champions of this law are now striving
to make the people of the United States become!</p>

<p>The right of cross examining witnesses is a common-law
right, appertaining to all kinds of trials. It is a
right without which all trials are but mockery. It is
oftentimes a hardship to be confronted with witnesses
of whom one knows nothing; but to be debarred from
all opportunity of getting, by cross questioning, at the
knowledge that is in them; to be debarred from the
right of showing that they are incompetent even to
folly, or corrupt even to wilful perjury, this is a barbarity
unknown to any code in the civilized world,
save to the code of the United States of America. It
is what even barbarians might be ashamed of. It is
offering bounties and premiums on villany, and turning
the courts into brokers’ offices for perjury. Under
such a law, is there a single colored person at the north
who can rise to his labor in the morning, or lie down
to his repose at night, with any feeling of security that
avarice and false swearing may not then be at work
for his destruction? Who can wonder, if he is tormented
in his nightly dreams by images of the man-stealer,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_452">[Pg 452]</span>
in far off regions, plotting for his ruin? Who
can wonder if, in his city residence, he starts as he
turns the corner of every street; or, in his rural home,
if he shudders at the rustle of every leaf, lest some
kidnapper should spring from his ambush to seize
him? That sense of personal security which every
honest man is entitled to feel, this law abolishes. The
virtuous man cannot rely upon his government, nor the
pious man upon his God, for earthly protection. For
him the Prince of Darkness has obtained the ascendency
in the affairs of men, and offers impunity to guilt,
while protection is withdrawn from innocence. The
life of such a man is a perpetual agony of alarm for
himself and for his family. A cloud charged with
lightning is forever suspended over his head, and no
genius can devise the means to turn aside its bolts.</p>

<p>Sir, before God, I believe that, in the judgment of an
impartial posterity, this method of taking evidence, by
the cruellest of means and for the wickedest of purposes,
will be held as atrocious and as execrable as that
horrid method of extracting evidence by torture, which
once prevailed, but which now even half-civilized nations
have abolished. A brave heart could withhold a
false confession, even upon the rack. With the
images of wife and children before the eyes, martyrdom
for their protection has been sweet. But there is
no man whom God ever made who will not tremble,
and stand aghast with consternation, with the conscious
knowledge in his mind that he, his wife and
children, and all that he holds dear upon earth, are at
the mercy of every pirate-hearted villain between the
Atlantic and the Rio Grande; nay, that the government
offers inducement to foreign assassins to come
here, where, with less risk, they can make more money
by false swearing and judicial kidnapping than they
could at home by murder and robbery. Better, a
thousand times better, had the constitution allowed the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_453">[Pg 453]</span>
citizen “to be compelled to be a witness against himself,”
and laid its prohibitions upon the fabrication of
testimony against him in his absence.</p>

<p>The tenth section of the act declares that this evidence,
thus obtained under a foreign jurisdiction and
in the absence of the party, shall be “<i>conclusive</i>.”
Now, the legal force and meaning of this provision is,
that no amount or weight of evidence, no array of the
most unimpeachable witnesses, not even the personal
knowledge of the commissioner himself, who tries the
case, though given under the sanction of an oath,
which the law does not require him, as a commissioner,
to take, shall be admissible to rebut this “conclusive”
testimony. It is not made <i>prima facie</i> evidence merely
against the respondent; it does not merely shift the
burden of proof, so that the presumptive freeman becomes
presumptively a slave, and must himself establish
the freedom he would possess; but the law magnifies
it into a species of proof that is “conclusive,”—that
is, unquestionable, irrefragable, omnipotent,—like
a miracle of God, not to be disputed. And this greatest
of legal force is given to the worst kind of evidence.
I say that a law so worthy of abhorrence, so truculent,
so fiendish, is not to be found upon the statute book
of any other civilized nation on the globe.</p>

<p>Such, too, has been the practical construction given
to the law. I see by the papers that, in a late case
which occurred at Detroit, the respondent declared
himself a free man, and prayed for a continuance, to
allow him to send to Cincinnati for his free papers.
But the commissioner refused the delay, saying that,
under this law, even free papers from the very man
that claimed him would be of no avail; for where
the law made the evidence <i>conclusive</i>, nothing could
rebut it. Any counter evidence must always be admitted,
on the hypothesis that the evidence already
received may be controlled by it. But what an infinite<span class="pagenum" id="Page_454">[Pg 454]</span>
absurdity to suppose that one mass or body of
proof can be <i>conclusive</i>, over another which is <i>conclusive</i>.
The law might just as well have made <i>color</i>
conclusive, not only that the respondent was a slave,
but that he ran away from the man who claims him.
The law, as it stands, is as much a slave-making as it
is a slave-catching law.</p>

<p>It declares that the proceedings shall be “summary;”
and it provides a different rate of compensation, according
as the decision is for freedom or against it. On
what principle is this difference of compensation
founded? Every body can see at a glance that when
a claimant can prepare his evidence beforehand and in
secret, he would be a fool not to make out a <i>prima
facie</i> case. If the respondent adduces no proof, the
case goes by default, and judgment, without delay, is
entered against him. But if the claim is contested,
then witnesses are to be examined, arguments are to
be heard, evidence is to be weighed, legal questions to
be investigated, and such a decision made as the commissioner
is willing to pronounce before the world. It
is only in the last class of cases, the contested class,
that the respondent will be discharged. The cases,
therefore, that result in freedom will ordinarily occupy
sixfold or tenfold more time, besides requiring the
exercise of more legal knowledge and ability, than
those which terminate fatally to the respondent. Yet
for decreeing the freedom of a man, the fee is but
half as much as when a sentence of bondage is
awarded against him. This surpasses the bribery of
Judas by the high priests. They had not diabolical
wit enough to present a contrast between right and
wrong, as a special stimulus for committing iniquity.</p>

<p>The “summary manner” of trial provided for by
this law, when considered in reference to rights so
momentous, shocks every Anglo-Saxon mind. One’s
blood must all be corrupted in his veins, before he can<span class="pagenum" id="Page_455">[Pg 455]</span>
hear of it without indignation. It is the noblest attribute
of our race, that we hold civil and religious liberty
to be more sacred and more precious than life itself.
Yet by what safeguards of constitution, of law, and
of forms of practice, is life protected amongst us?
There must be a presentment, by at least twelve sworn
men, before a man can be held to answer to a charge
by which it can be forfeited. Then come the traverse
jury, the right of peremptory challenge, the
assignment of counsel, the right to see the indictment
beforehand, and to know the names of witnesses who
are to be called against the accused, and compulsory
process to insure the attendance of witnesses in his
favor! What noble barriers are these against the
oppression of a powerful government, and the malignant
passions of powerful men! The probable culprit,—the
man laboring under the most violent suspicion,—though
caught with the blood-red dagger in his
hand over the prostrate body of the victim, is guarded
by all that human ingenuity has been able to devise;
by all the knowledge that we can command this side
of the omniscience, and by all the power this side of
the omnipotence of God. Yet in the very community
where these rights are reverenced and upheld, a
man may be seized without notice, hurried to a tribunal
without an hour for preparation, and then be borne
away a thousand miles, where all that life has of hope
and of enjoyment is taken away, and all that it knows
of misery and of terror is realized.</p>

<p>Let me ask any man who ever had a case in court
that was worth defending, whether he was prepared to
meet it the first hour he had notice of its existence?
A respondent’s witnesses may be resident in different
states, and distances of hundreds of miles may intervene
between him and them. His proof may consist
of deeds, or wills, or records, which cannot be found
or authenticated without delay. His defence may<span class="pagenum" id="Page_456">[Pg 456]</span>
consist of matters of law, which the ablest counsel
may require time and the examination of books to investigate.
All these obstacles to instantaneous readiness
may exist together, and yet the inexorable mandate
of the law scorns his appeal for that delay on
which his highest interests are suspended, and dooms
him to bondage because he cannot achieve impossibilities.
Under such a law, not one man in ten who will
be arrested, even though he should be free, will be
prepared to establish his freedom. A great portion of
these outcasts from human justice, I doubt not, are
better prepared for the summons of instantaneous
death than for this summons of instantaneous trial.</p>

<p>Then the cruel haste in executing judgment! The
murderer is allowed a season of respite between the
hour of sentence and the hour of death; the debtor
may turn out goods to satisfy a creditor’s demands;
but the alleged fugitive has no reprieve. He has no
opportunity to solicit money to redeem himself, or to
negotiate for the ransom of body and soul. Swift and
sure as an arrow to its mark, he is speeded on his way
to the abodes of toil and despair. The witnesses who
swore away his liberty may have been perjured, but he
cannot stop to convict them. The court may have
been corrupt, but he cannot remain to impeach it.
However honestly rendered, the judgment may be reversible
for error in law, but he cannot stay to set it
aside.</p>

<p>Now, every one must see that where there is so little
caution before trial, there should be a liberal opportunity
for revision after it. But here is infinite exposure
to error with no chance for rectification. Overstepping
the acts of the common tyrant, there is an infliction
of the most heinous wrong, with a premeditated
purpose that it shall not be repaired. The great and
free republic of North America has transferred the
unwritten law of Judge Lynch to its statute book.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_457">[Pg 457]</span></p>

<p>However clear the constitutional obligation of Congress
to enact a law for the reclamation of fugitive
slaves may be supposed by any one to be, there certainly
are limitations to this obligation, which all the
principles of our government forbid the law-maker to
transcend.</p>

<p>In the first place, this constitutional obligation must
be strictly construed. The main and primary object
of the constitution was to protect natural rights;
but the object of the Fugitive Slave clause was to
protect a legal right in conflict with natural right. All
judges of an honorable name, all courts in all civilized
communities, have recognized a broad distinction in
the principles of interpreting law. They have held
that provisions against life and liberty should be strictly
construed, while those in favor of life and liberty
should be liberally construed,—the one so construed
as to inflict as little of pain and privation as possible;
the other, to give as much of freedom and immunity
as possible. These have become maxims, or axioms,
of legal interpretation; and in their long and unbroken
recognition, it is not too strong an expression to say,
they impetrate and command a strict construction of
that clause in the constitution under which fugitives
may be claimed. And the same legal maxims, in
regard to all subjects touching life and liberty, bind
Congress in legislating under the constitution, as bind
the judicial tribunals in administering the law.</p>

<p>Yet the Fugitive Slave law contains provisions
which there can be no pretence nor shadow of a pretence
that the constitution requires. By the constitution,
“No person held to service or labor in one state,
escaping into <i>another</i>, shall be discharged.” Into
<i>another</i> what? Indisputably, into another <i>state</i>. It
must mean <i>state</i>, and can mean nothing else; for the
laws of language admit no other construction. The
expression, “No person held in one <i>state</i>, escaping<span class="pagenum" id="Page_458">[Pg 458]</span>
into <i>another</i> <span class="allsmcap">TERRITORY</span>,” would be not merely ungrammatical
and un-English, but nonsensical. No
man of common intelligence ever so construed a sentence.
Yet the sixth section of the act provides not
only for the case of slaves escaping from one state into
another state, but for their escape from a state into a
<i>territory</i>, and for an escape from a <i>territory</i> into a
state, and for an escape from one <i>territory</i> into another
<i>territory</i>. Four classes of cases are provided for by
the law, while but one of them finds any warrant in
the constitution.</p>

<p>Now let any one take a map of the United States,
and see over what a vast area the law extends, over
which the provision in the constitution does not extend.
The region is continental over which the law unconstitutionally
extends, and this corresponds with the
vast inhumanity of the principle which so extends it.</p>

<p>Mark another particular in which the provisions of
the law go beyond the requirements of the constitution.
The constitution says the fugitive shall be
“delivered up.” The law makes provision for transporting
him to the claimant’s home. Is there any
similar provision respecting any other species of property?
If a northern merchant recovers a debt from
his southern customer, does the government assume
the responsibility of seeing that it is paid to the creditor
at his own home? If a northern man is robbed,
and the stolen goods are found in another state, does
the government transport them back and pay freight?
Then, why should government interpose in this case
to bear costs and risks, unless slavery is so meritorious
an institution as to deserve the benefactions as well as
the benedictions of freemen?</p>

<p>Then observe how artfully the law is worded, to
make the assistance rendered to the claimant go beyond
any supposed necessity in the case. “If,” it
says, “upon affidavit made by the claimant, ...<span class="pagenum" id="Page_459">[Pg 459]</span>
his agent or attorney, ... that he has reason to
apprehend that such fugitive will be rescued by force, ... before
he can take him <i>beyond the limits of
the state in which the arrest is made</i>, it shall be the
duty of the officer ... to remove him <i>to the state
whence he fled</i>.” Thus, if danger is apprehended,
<i>within the first ten miles</i>, the government shall see
the slave safely home, at its own expense, <i>though it
be a thousand miles</i>.</p>

<p>But besides the unheard-of principle of saddling
the government with the expense of prosecuting the
private claims of its citizens within its own jurisdiction,
I should like to know what provision the constitution
contains, which, though interpreted by the most
latitudinarian constructionist, confers any right upon
Congress thus to take the money of one citizen to pay
the private expenses of another. There is no clause,
or phrase, or word in that instrument which favors the
idea that the Northern States should bear the expense,
as well as the disgrace, of thus remanding our fellow-men
into bondage.</p>

<p>Besides, if the limits of the constitution were to be
transcended in order to deliver an alleged fugitive to
his master, would not the slightest element of equity,
or decency, even, require that when a freeman is condemned
to bondage under the law, his expenses,
incurred in returning to the place where he was plundered
of himself, should be reimbursed to him by the
government which had failed in its duty to protect
him? If the claimant of James Hamlet could be
supplied with a force, at the government’s expense, to
carry him into slavery, why should not the expense
of coming back into a land of freedom be reimbursed
by the government to Adam Gibson, after one of its
venal and villanous instruments had wrested that
freedom from him?</p>

<p>The law also provides for another thing which the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_460">[Pg 460]</span>
supreme court has expressly declared to be unconstitutional,
or beyond the power of Congress to enact. It
provides that any <i>state</i> court of record, or judge
thereof, in vacation, may take and certify evidence
which shall be “conclusive” in regard to two of the
three points which are made sufficient by the law to
prove a man a slave. Thus, the two facts of slavery
and of escape may be “conclusively” proved by the
certificate of a judge of a <i>state</i> court, so that the
judge before whom the alleged fugitive is brought
shall, in regard to these facts, exercise only a mere
ministerial function. Now, he who has power to take
and authenticate evidence, which it is predetermined
shall be “conclusive” in the case, has power to decide
the case. This, in its nature and essence, is a judicial
power; yet this power is given by the act to any <i>state</i>
court of record, and to any judge thereof in vacation.
Contrary to this, however, the supreme court has said,
“Congress cannot vest any portion of the judicial
power of the United States except in courts ordained
and established by itself.”—<i>Martin</i> vs. <i>Hunter’s
Lessee</i>, 1 Wheat. 330. “The whole judicial power
of the United States should be, at all times, vested in
some courts created under its authority.”—<i>Ib.</i> 331.
“The jurisdiction over such cases, [cases arising under
the constitution, laws, and treaties of the United
States,] could not exist in the state courts previous
to the adoption of the constitution, and it could not
afterwards be directly conferred on them; for the
constitution expressly requires the judicial power to
be vested in courts ordained and established by the
United States.”—<i>Ib.</i> 335.</p>

<p>Yet, though it is expressly declared that Congress
cannot vest any part of the judicial power of the
United States in a state court, the state courts are
empowered by this law to take and certify evidence,
which is made “conclusive” in the case.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_461">[Pg 461]</span></p>

<p>Look at the subject in another of its aspects. Here
are some half million of free colored persons in the
free states. <i>They</i> are unquestionably free. They
possess, as fully as you or I, those prerogatives of
freedom without which life ceases to be a blessing.
Their freedom is guarantied to them by the constitution
of the United States, and by the constitutions and
laws of the states respectively in which they dwell.
They certainly are a part of the people. In some of
the states, as in Massachusetts for instance, the law
knows no iota of distinction, in any respect, between
a black man and a white man; between one of European
and one of African descent. It is the noble
privilege of a Massachusetts man to say, that, as all
men are equal before the divine law, so are all men
equal within our borders, before the human law.</p>

<p>Now, scattered among this half million, more or
less, of free colored people in the free states, there are
a few hundreds, or a few thousands if you please, of
“fugitives from service or labor,” as the constitution
cunningly and evasively phrases it; which, being
interpreted, means, as the whole world knows, fugitives
from toil, and fetters, and stripes, and agony;
fugitives from ignorance and the thick darkness of the
intellect; fugitives from moral debasement, and from
that enforced pollution of body and soul that spares
neither wife, nor mother, nor a daughter’s innocence;
fugitives from the disruption of family ties, and from
the laceration of all human affections; fugitives, in
fine, from a heathenism of superstition and religious
blindness into the glorious light of the gospel of Jesus
Christ.</p>

<p>Now this free class and this fugitive class belong
ethnologically to the same race. They speak the same
language, and wear the same distinctive characteristics
of feature and of form. All the unspeakable privileges,
all the sacred titles and immunities of the one<span class="pagenum" id="Page_462">[Pg 462]</span>
class are enshrined in the same complexion and in the
same contour of person that attend the debasement
and privation of the other. The vessels of honor and
of glory are moulded into the same shape with the
vessels of dishonor and of shame.</p>

<p>Now, after this debased class has been created by a
wicked system of human laws, and after it is mingled
with the free class, another law steps in and decrees
that the former shall be remanded to their bondage.
An awful decree! second in terribleness only to that
which shall divide between the blessed and the accursed
before the judgment-seat of God. Within the
compass of human action, there never was an occasion
that demanded more unerring justice and wisdom, that
invoked more foresight and solicitude, that appealed
more touchingly to every sentiment and instinct congenial
to liberty, with which God has endowed and
ennobled the soul of man, so to devise the law, if law
there must be, as not to involve the free in the horrible
doom of the enslaved. If, in the administration of
penal laws, a knowledge of human fallibility has
forced the maxim into existence and into practice,
that it is better that ninety-nine guilty persons should
escape than that one innocent man should suffer, ought
not the same benign rule to be adopted in our legislation
whenever there is a possibility of exposing the
free to the fearful fate of the enslaved? But instead
of this jealousy and circumspection, what have we?
A law whose first utterance abjures the distinction
between freedom and bondage; a law which brings
the whole free colored population of the United States
within the outer circles of the whirlpool of slavery,
that they may be ingulfed in its vortex; a law which
empowers every villain in the country, by fabricating
false testimony at his own leisure and convenience, to
use his own freedom in order to rob other people of
theirs! I aver, that before any moral tribunal, where<span class="pagenum" id="Page_463">[Pg 463]</span>
right and wrong are weighed in the balances of the
sanctuary, there is not a felony described in the whole
statute book that is more felonious than such a law.</p>

<p>It has become an axiom in the administration of
justice,—an axiom slowly evolved by the wisdom of
ages, but now firmly established and incorporated into
the jurisprudence of every civilized community,—that
the ethical policy of the law will tolerate no rule
of action that opens the door to fraud or crime, but
will even vacate solemn contracts between parties
otherwise competent, in its jealousy and apprehension
of wrong. Hence the law applicable to common carriers,
which will not allow a man to exonerate himself
from liability even by express notice, lest opportunity
should be given for collusion and fraud. Hence, too,
the principle of law which forbids an insolvent debtor
to pay, or even to contract to pay, a <i>bona fide</i> creditor
in anticipation of bankruptcy. Now, this principle
applies with tenfold force to legislators,—withholding
and repelling them from passing any law which may
involve the innocent in the fate of the guilty, or the
free in the bondage of the enslaved.</p>

<p>But the law violates a still deeper principle than
these. I do not recollect the instance of a single
northern man or northern press, utterly false to freedom,
and venal as so many of them have been, that
has expressed entire satisfaction with the law. They
palliate it, they strive, by seductive party and pecuniary
appeals, to beguile men into its support. They
look outside of it for pretexts to hide its inherent baseness;
but not one of them, so far as I know, has had
the effrontery to justify it on its intrinsic merits. Even
those northern men who voted for it have sought refuge
from the storm of righteous indignation that burst
upon them, by alleging that it was an essential ingredient
in a system of measures, and entered, as a
necessary element, into a desirable compromise.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_464">[Pg 464]</span></p>

<p>When this language is translated, what does it
mean? Simply this, and no more. California was
admitted, and thereby certain political and commercial
advantages were gained. This, in legal language, was
the consideration. The Fugitive Slave law was passed,
and thereby the rights of freemen, the property of
men in themselves, all the household sanctities, all the
domestic endearments of half a million of men, were
put in peril. This was the equivalent given! A mere
barter of the holiest interests for worldly advantages!
And these interests were given away by men who did
not own them, and therefore had no right to transfer
them. The whites, north and south, played a game,
and made the black people their stakes. Who authorized
the law-makers to derive a benefit to themselves
from doing this infinite wrong to others? Who gave
them the terrible prerogative of making others suffer
for their pleasure. I say it with reverence, but I still
say it with emphasis, that we cannot conceive of God
himself as having power to inflict vicarious suffering
without the free consent of the sufferer! Yet the
atrocities of this law are defended by those who made
it, on the ground that they and other white men have
secured benefits to themselves by sacrificing the liberty,
happiness and peace of half a million of their
fellow-beings of a different color. Cause and counsellor
are alike; for the defence is as profligate as the
act it defends.</p>

<p>I say, sir, it is the population of African descent
in the free states which is specially put in peril by
this law. Occasionally, indeed, persons of unmixed
white blood are seized and enslaved under it. These
cases, however, are comparatively rare. But suppose
the reverse. Suppose circumstances to be such that
the whole body of the white population should be as
much endangered by it as the colored people now are.
Suppose that not only the white voters themselves,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_465">[Pg 465]</span>
but their wives and their children, were as liable to
be “<i>Ingrahamed</i>,” as the blacks; suppose this, I say,
and would the existence of the law be tolerated for
an hour? Would there not be an uprising of the
people, simultaneous and universal against it, and such
a yell of execration as never before burst from mortal
lips? The name of every man who had voted for it,
or who should defend it, would be entered upon that
apostate list at whose head stands the name of Judas.
Christian and Infidel, Jew and Gentile, would execrate
it alike. Why, then, if they would do this to avert
such peril from themselves and their families, do they
not do it when their sable brethren are in jeopardy?
Alas! there is but one answer! From selfish considerations,
from the love of wealth, or the love of
power, they have discarded that heaven-descended
maxim, “Whatever ye would that men should do unto
you, do ye the same unto them.”</p>

<p>And it is this very class of men who have thus
abjured the precepts of Jesus Christ, who have trampled
upon the divine doctrines of liberty and love,
that now so clamorously summon us to an obedience
to law.</p>

<p>In answer to this call, let me say, that true obedience
to law is necessarily accompanied and preceded
by a reverence for those great principles of justice and
humanity without which all law is despotism. How
can a man pretend to any honest regard for the principle
of obedience to law when he is willing, as in the
case of this fugitive act, to transcend our constitutional
law, and to invade the divine law? It is but
an appeal to the lower rule of action to justify a violation
of the higher. Under the pretext of rendering
unto Cæsar the things that are Cæsar’s it denies to
God the things that are God’s.</p>

<p>And again, a true reverence for law is a general
principle, and not an isolated fact. It applies to all<span class="pagenum" id="Page_466">[Pg 466]</span>
laws collectively, and not to any one law in particular.
It bestows its greatest homage upon those laws
that embrace and confer the most of human welfare;
for, were all the laws of a community, or the great
majority of them, unrighteous, then disloyalty to law
would be the virtue. Can the class of men who demand
our allegiance to the Fugitive Slave law stand
this test? We have usury laws, which not only carry
the legal force of statutes, but the moral power of the
greatest names in legislation and in statesmanship.
Are the men in New York, in Philadelphia, and Boston,
who are most vehement in support of the Fugitive
Slave law, signalized for their regard to the statutes
against usury?</p>

<p>Is not money lent in all those cities on the same
principle that wreckers send a rope’s end to a drowning
man,—for as much as they can extort? It is
notorious that among the great body of merchants and
capitalists in those cities, interest is regulated by the
pressure upon the money market, and that no more
idea of law mingles with their contracts than in California,
where there is no law on the subject.</p>

<p>We have laws restricting the sale of intoxicating
liquors, and designed to promote the glorious object
of temperance. For which practice have our cities
been conspicuous,—for their obedience to these laws
or for their violation of them? A few years ago, when
a question of the constitutionality of a law of Massachusetts
for the restraint of intemperance arose, did not
its two distinguished senators appear in the supreme
court of the United States, and make the most strenuous
exertions to annul the law of their own state,
and to open anew the flood-gates for overwhelming
their own constituents in misery and ruin,—the selfsame
gentlemen who are now so intolerant even of
discussion?</p>

<p>Look at the complaints which come to us every day<span class="pagenum" id="Page_467">[Pg 467]</span>
from the friends of a protective tariff. They tell us
that our revenue laws are fraudulently and systematically
evaded; and they number the violations of these
laws by thousands and tens of thousands. Who are
the violators? Not men living in the country; not the
farmers and mechanics and laborers,—the substratum
of our strength and the origin of our power;—but
they are the city merchants, the getters-up of “Union
meetings,” and the members of “safety and vigilance
committees,” who are so earnest in inculcating those
lessons of obedience by their precepts, which they have
done so little to recommend by their example.</p>

<p>The Southern States are loud in their calls upon us
to execute the Fugitive Slave law. But what examples
have they set us on the subject of obedience to
law? I think I may be pardoned for mentioning a
few cases, to show how their preaching and practice
tally.</p>

<p>In 1831, the legislature of Georgia offered a bribe of
<i>five thousand dollars</i> to any one who would arrest,
and bring to trial and conviction, in Georgia, a citizen
of Massachusetts, named William Lloyd Garrison.
This law was “approved” by William Lumpkin, governor,
on the 26th December, 1831. Mr. Garrison had
never stepped foot within the limits of Georgia, and
therefore it was not a reward for his trial and conviction,
but for his abduction and murder.</p>

<p>At a meeting of slaveholders, held at Sterling, in the
same state, September 4, 1835, it was formally recommended
to the governor, to offer, by proclamation, the
five thousand dollars appropriated by the act of 1831,
for the apprehension of either of ten persons, citizens,
with one exception, of New York, or Massachusetts,
whose names were given; not one of whom, it was
not even pretended, had ever been within the limits of
Georgia.</p>

<p>The Milledgeville, Georgia, “Federal Union,” of<span class="pagenum" id="Page_468">[Pg 468]</span>
February 1, 1836, contained an offer of $10,000 for
kidnapping A. A. Phelps, a clergyman of the city of
New York.</p>

<p>The committee of vigilance, (another “committee
of vigilance,”) of the parish of East Feliciana, offered,
in the Louisville Journal, of October 15, 1835, $50,000
to any person who would deliver into their hands
Arthur Tappan, a merchant of New York.</p>

<p>At a public meeting of the citizens of Mount Meigs,
Alabama, August 13, 1836, the <i>honorable</i> Bedford
Ginress in the chair, a reward of $50,000 was offered
for the apprehension of the same Arthur Tappan, or
of Le Roy Sunderland, a Methodist clergyman of New
York.</p>

<p>Repeated instances have occurred in which the governors
of slave states,—Virginia, Georgia, Kentucky,
Alabama, &amp;c.,—have made requisitions upon the governors
of free states, under the second section of the
fourth article of the constitution, for the surrender of
free citizens, <i>as fugitives from justice</i>, when it was
well known that the citizens so demanded were not
within the limits of the slave states at the time when
the alleged offence was committed, and, in some instances,
had never been there in their lives,—high
executive perversions of the constitution of the United
States, by chief magistrates who had sworn to support
it!</p>

<p>For nearly twenty years past the post-office laws of
the United States have been systematically violated in
slave states, the mail bags rifled, and their contents
seized and publicly burned; and, in some instances,
these violations have been enjoined, under heavy penalties,
by a law of the states. There are several of the
slave states on whose statute books these laws, commanding
a violation of the post-office, stand to-day.</p>

<p>During Mr. Adams’s administration, a man by the
name of Tassels, in Georgia, was adjudged to be hanged,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_469">[Pg 469]</span>
under a law of the state, as clearly unconstitutional as
was ever passed. A writ of error was sued out from
the supreme court of the United States, in order to
bring the case before that tribunal for revision. But
the state of Georgia anticipated the service of the writ,
and made sure of its victim by hanging him extemporaneously.</p>

<p>Within a few weeks past,—the accounts having but
just now reached us,—an aged and most respectable individual
of the name of Harris, a citizen of New Hampshire,
has been tried by a mob in South Carolina, and
tarred and feathered, because he happened to have <i>in
his trunk</i> a sermon which had been sent to him by one
of his acquaintances, a clergyman at the north; though
he had never showed the sermon to a single individual,
nor whispered a word of its contents. Another man, a
Dr. Coles, belonging to Boston, who had been lecturing
on the subject of physiology, was, within a few days,
seized and carried before a magistrate, in the same
state, his trunks rifled, the private letters sent to him by
his wife and family publicly read, with the most indecent
comments, and all without any shadow of reasonable
suspicion against him.</p>

<p>The unconstitutional imprisonment of northern seamen
in southern ports is an occurrence so frequent, and
so universally known, that I need not spend time to
enumerate or to describe the cases.</p>

<p>The President of the United States has made proclamation,
and proffered the military and naval force of
the United States, to aid any southern slave owner in
reducing his fugitive slave to a new bondage; but I
have not heard that he has made any similar proclamation,
or manifested any anxiety for the support of that
part of the constitution which says that “the citizens
of each state shall be entitled to all the privileges and
immunities of citizens in the several states.”</p>

<p>Now, with a few exceptions, it is these very classes<span class="pagenum" id="Page_470">[Pg 470]</span>
of men who violate the laws against extortion and
usury; who break down the barriers against the desolations
of intemperance; who, almost alone of all our
citizens, are implicated in the breach of the revenue
laws; who annul the post-office laws of the United
States; who offer rewards for free northern citizens,
that they may get them in their clutch to lynch and
murder them; who demand free citizens as fugitives
from justice, in states where they have never been, and
who imprison free citizens and sell them into slavery;—it
is these classes of men who are now so suddenly
smitten with a new sense of the sacredness of law, and
of the duty of obedience to law,—not of the laws of
God, not even of the laws of man, in general, but of this
most abominable of all enactments, the Fugitive Slave
law in particular.</p>

<p>I do not cite the above cases from among a thousand
similar ones, as any justification or apology for forcible
and organized resistance to law by those who even
constructively can be said to have given it their consent.
But the words of a preacher do not “come
mended from his tongue,” when his name is a scandal
among men for his violation of all the precepts he
enjoins.</p>

<p>And now, sir, when I am called upon to support
such a law as this, or to desist from opposing it in all
constitutional ways, while it lasts, my response is, repeal
the law, that I may no longer be called upon to
support it. In the name of my constituents, and by
the memory of that “old man eloquent,” in whose
place it is my fortune to stand, I demand its repeal. I
demand it,—</p>

<p>Because it is a law which wars against the fundamental
principles of human liberty.</p>

<p>Because it is a law which conflicts with the constitution
of the country, and with all the judicial interpretations
of that constitution, wherever they have been
applied to the white race.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_471">[Pg 471]</span></p>

<p>Because it is a law which introduces a fatal principle
into the code of evidence, and into judicial practice,—a
principle, before which no man’s liberties and no
man’s rights of any kind can stand.</p>

<p>Because it is a law which is abhorrent to the moral
and religious sentiments of a vast majority of the community
that is called upon to enforce it.</p>

<p>Because the life and character of so many of its
apologists and supporters are themselves potent arguments
against whatever they may advocate.</p>

<p>Because it is a law which, if executed in the free
states, divests them of the character of free states, and
makes them voluntary participators in the guilt of
slaveholding.</p>

<p>Because it is a law which disgraces our country in
the eyes of the whole civilized world, and gives plausible
occasion to the votaries of despotic power to decry
republican institutions.</p>

<p>Because it is a law which forbids us to do unto
others as we would have them do to us, and which
makes it a crime to feed the hungry, to clothe the
naked, and to visit and succor the sick and the imprisoned.</p>

<p>Because it is a law which renders the precepts of the
gospel and the teachings of Jesus Christ seditious;
and, were the Savior and his band of disciples now
upon earth, there is but one of them who would escape
its penalties by pretending “to conquer his prejudices.”
And, finally,</p>

<p>Because the advocates and defenders of this law
have been compelled to place its defence upon the express
ground that the commandments of men are of
higher authority than the ordinances of God.</p>

<p>In Hooker’s sublime description of law, when understood
in its generic sense, he says,—</p>

<p>“Of law there can be no less acknowledged than
that her seat is the bosom of God, her voice the harmony<span class="pagenum" id="Page_472">[Pg 472]</span>
of the world; all things in heaven and earth do
her homage, the very least as feeling her care, and the
greatest as not exempted from her power; both angels,
and men, and creatures, of what condition soever,
though each in different sort and manner, yet all with
uniform consent, admiring her as the mother of their
peace and joy.”</p>

<p>Now, sir, with these glorious attributes of “law,” I
say the Fugitive Slave law of the last session possesses
not one quality in common, nor in similitude. To say
that the seat of such a law is in the “bosom of God,”
is the intensest blasphemy. To say that it is “the harmony
of the world,” is to declare that the world is a
sphere of ubiquitous and omnipotent wrong, uncheckered
by any thought of justice, and devoid of any emotion
of love. To say that “all things in heaven do
homage” to such a law, is to affirm of the realms of
light what is true only of the realms of darkness. The
“least” do not “feel its care,” but tremble and wail
beneath its cruelty; while the “greatest” and the
strongest <i>are</i> “exempt from its power;” for they made
it not for themselves but for others. To no class of
“creatures,” rational or irrational, human or divine,
can it prove to be the “mother of peace and joy;”
but wherever it extends, and as long as it exists, it will
continue to be an overflowing Marah of bitterness and
strife.</p>

<p>As the great name of Hooker has been profanely
cited in behalf of this law, I will close by quoting his
distinction between those laws of human governments
which ought to be obeyed, and those which ought
not:—</p>

<p>——“which laws,” says he, “we must obey, <i>unless
there be reason showed which may necessarily enforce
that</i> <span class="smcap">the law of reason or of God doth enjoin the
contrary</span>.”</p>

<p><span class="smcap">On the Fugitive Slave Law, delivered at Lancaster,
Massachusetts, May 19, 1851, pending the Canvass for
a Member of Congress for the Fourth Congressional
District.</span></p>
</div>


<p>
<span class="smcap">Fellow-Citizens</span>;<br>
</p>

<p>We are assembled on a great occasion and for a great
purpose. The election of a member of Congress, indeed,
is not an extraordinary event; but it is extraordinary
that principles of the most vital importance to
the honor of Massachusetts, and to the cause of human
liberty throughout the world, should be involved in a
local election. Such, however, is now the fact.</p>

<p>Gentlemen, the assertion and the recognition of the
rights of man have made great progress among the
nations of Europe within the recollection of many
who are now before me. Notwithstanding the partition
of Poland by allied robbers, and the obliteration
of that kingdom from the map of Europe; notwithstanding
Hungarian subjugation to Austrian despotism,
and many other atrocious crimes against humanity,
such as nations only can commit; for they are too vast
and monstrous to be perpetrated by any individual,—I
say, notwithstanding these facts, the great fabric of
human liberty has been rising in Europe, while the
solid structures of despotism have been disintegrating
and making ready for their fall.</p>

<p>But truth compels me to acknowledge that, during
the last three quarters of a century, our course, in this
country, has been downward. While among the
other nations of Christendom the altar-fires of liberty<span class="pagenum" id="Page_474">[Pg 474]</span>
have been kindling and burning with a brighter flame,
ours have been waning. At the foundation of our
government an institution existed amongst us utterly
irreconcilable with the fundamental principles of the
government itself. But it was then limited in its
extent, and its spirit nowhere existed in great intensity.
Even those who cherished it most were
ashamed of it; and in those provisions of the constitution
which were designed for its temporary protection,
a common regard for decency forbade the mention
of its name. Fatally to our own peace and honor,
that which was then regarded as temporary and local,
now threatens to be abiding and universal. From
speaking of slavery with hushed breath, its bold abettors
now shout forth its praises. From providing for
the extermination of the African slave trade, they have
converted the slave states into another Africa, this
side the tropics; and by the successful robbery of a
neighboring republic, they seek to create a new America,
so that the slave trade, once abolished and declared
piracy, may be revived and legalized. The
Middle Passage is to be transferred from the ocean to
the land. Maryland, Virginia, Kentucky, &amp;c., are to
be the Gold Coast, Benin, and the Galinas; the place
of supply, the place of demand, and the highways of
commerce between them are to be within our own
borders and protected by the American flag; and that
horrid traffic which all the leading nations of Christendom
united in declaring to be a felony punishable with
death, is now to be maintained and defended amongst
ourselves, under penalty of death and a dissolution of
the Union.</p>

<p>Nor does it suffice that the tide of slavery should
rise and overflow the vast and uninhabited regions of
the west. It surges up against the free states themselves,
and all the dikes and barriers of that constitutional
law which we have been enacting for seventy-five<span class="pagenum" id="Page_475">[Pg 475]</span>
years, cannot stay its flood. We thought that
Massachusetts was the impregnable citadel of freedom;
but unconstitutional and inhuman laws, dictated by
slaveholders, are now enforced amongst us, and at our
very doors; and our services are commanded for their
execution.</p>

<p>Thank God, there is a part of our people who,
while they suffer, resist. Only a portion amongst us
have reached that lowest depth of degradation, where
they surrender, not their limbs only, but their wills, to
the hateful service of their masters. Slavery has done
its perfect work only when the soul is enslaved. I
rejoice to believe that we have not only seven thousand
in this our Massachusetts Israel, who have not
bowed the knee to Baal, but seven hundred thousand;
and recent events foretell not only an increasing number,
but a more determined opposition.</p>

<p>Why is it, fellow-citizens, that Massachusetts stands
first, or among the first, in 1851, in her hostility to the
Fugitive Slave law? I answer, for the very reason
that she stood first in her hostility to the encroachments
of the British crown in 1776. And in less
than seventy-five years from this time, those who oppose
and those who defend this inhuman law, will
stand, historically, as wide asunder, and will share as
high an honor or suffer as deep an ignominy, as is now
awarded to the lovers of freedom and the minions of
power who lived at the era of the revolution. Let
all young men beware not to be seduced by any temptations
of immediate profit or mistaken honor, to lift a
hand in defence of this law. If they do, then, before
they have lived out half their lives, they will be as
ready as old Cranmer to thrust the offending member
into the flames, and to say with him, “This hand, this
wicked hand, has offended.”</p>

<p>Gentlemen, we in Massachusetts are a Union-loving,
and law-abiding people. Mr. Webster and his “retainers”<span class="pagenum" id="Page_476">[Pg 476]</span>
may spare their breath in exhorting us to abide
by the Union. Such a work, in this commonwealth, is
a work of supererogation. He knows, and they know,
that the number of disunionists in this state can be
counted on a man’s fingers and toes. Whatever influence
they exert must flow from their zeal, their talents,
and their private character; for they derive none from
numerical force. Were they all to settle in one of our
small towns, they would be out-voted by its inhabitants.
I regard these ever-repeated appeals made to
Massachusetts men and to New England men to stand
by the Union, as not merely obtrusive, but as affrontive
and insulting. Besides, when a man undertakes
the mission of going round the country, preaching
honesty, or temperance, or chastity, he provokes the
inquiry whether he is more honest, temperate, or continent
than those whom he exhorts. If the union of
these states now is, or has ever been verging towards
a point of danger, it is solely and only because ambitious
men and mercenary men at the north have given
it that direction by recognizing southern threats and
bravadoes as realities, and thus encouraging them.
Let the greatest coward see that his threats are acknowledged
as verities, and he will adopt the cheap
mode of threatening instead of the hazardous one of
acting. Could the Chinese have frightened away the
British fleet by their battery of wooden cannon, having
the middle of the ends painted black for a muzzle,
they would have been fools to incur the expense of
brass or iron. But John Bull did not care whether the
cannon were of wood or of metal, and at his first fire
the Celestials scampered. But here, when a few men
in a few states pointed their wooden guns at us, Mr.
Webster, General Cass, and others, for their own ambitious
purposes, cried out that the Union was in danger.
I say, then, if the union of these states ever
has been in any proximity to danger, it was not from<span class="pagenum" id="Page_477">[Pg 477]</span>
menaces uttered by the south, but from northern indorsement
of them. If northern leaders had dishonored
instead of indorsing this spurious paper, it never
would have got into circulation.</p>

<p>We are not only Union-loving men, but, as I said
before, we are law-abiding men. Had this not been
so, not all the fleets and armies in the world could have
carried Thomas Sims into bondage. So intimately
blended is the reverence for law with the very soul of
our people, that if you could convince them that a
statute has legal force and is binding upon the conscience,
I verily believe our juries would give a verdict
in favor of Shylock, though the pound of flesh which
he claimed were to be carved from their own bosoms.
This side of a just cause for revolution, they will yield
submission to all laws enacted by the government,
with one single exception. The exception I mean,
embraces those laws of men which are clearly contrary
to the law of God. And I trust the time is not
now, and never will be, when the children of the
Puritans will obey any commandment of human origin
if it conflicts with a divine command, though they
have to lie down in lions’ dens or walk through furnace
fires, as the penalty of disobedience.</p>

<p>But with this sentiment of reverence for law is
another sentiment, which is its proper attendant and
brother,—I mean a desire and a determination to
know what that is which is called <i>law</i>; what it is that
claims this prerogative of controlling the will and
challenging the conscience. It is in this spirit that
they have discussed and mean to discuss the Fugitive
Slave law, and to bring it, Protestant fashion, to the
test of individual judgment and conscience.</p>

<p>I have no need to repeat to you the general provisions
of this inhuman enactment. No lover of liberty
can read them without having their atrocious
character burned into his mind ineffaceably. You<span class="pagenum" id="Page_478">[Pg 478]</span>
know that it assumes to dispose of the highest interests
of human liberty,—the liberty of soul as well as
the liberty of person;—and you know that it also
assumes to dispose of the most precious interests of
property,—the property that a man has in himself and
in all his capacities of physical enjoyment and suffering
as well as his property in his money or his goods;—without
a single one of those safeguards and protections
which the constitution of the country builds
up like a rampart of defence around us all. This enactment,
too, is no theoretic affair; it is no dead letter
on the statute book. It is a living monster, uncaged
and turned loose amongst us, to rob and devour at its
will.</p>

<p>Now, I have two objections to this law, which absolve
me from all obligations to execute it, or, in any
way or manner, to assist in executing it. First, I believe
it to be contrary to the law of God, which, God
helping me, shall be the rule of my conduct, though I
should scatter political treasons as the autumn wind
scatters leaves. In his dread description of the judgment
day, Jesus Christ makes the distinction between
saints and sinners to turn upon the fact, whether they
have fed the hungry, clothed the naked, and visited
those who were sick and in prison. And who so
hungry as those who do not own, and cannot own a
morsel of bread? Who so naked as those who do not
own, and cannot own a shred of a garment to protect
them from cold, or from the lascivious eye? And what
confinement was ever so hopeless as southern slavery,
what prison was ever so deep as that prison-house
which holds three millions of our fellow-beings within
its melancholy walls,—them and their posterity forever?
He that refuses the common acts of hospitality to these
victims, when fleeing from their bondage, denies his
Lord and Master. He that refuses them, disobeys
every precept of the Savior, and has no more right to<span class="pagenum" id="Page_479">[Pg 479]</span>
call himself a Christian, than has the Fejee islander,
when he rises from his cannibal banquet. He is the
Levite who passes by on the other side.</p>

<p>And next, I hold this law to be contrary to the constitution
of the United States, and therefore of no
binding force upon my conscience or my conduct. I
do not mean to say by this that I shall make forcible
opposition to it. I take the Quaker ground upon this
subject; I will not assist to execute it, though I shall
suffer it to execute itself on me.</p>

<p>The constitutionality of this law has been extensively
discussed. But there is this broad difference
between the arguments of those who affirm and those
who deny that it is constitutional. Those who deny
it, argue the question upon its merits, upon principle,
upon those legal relations and analogies that so nobly
characterize the English law on the subject of human
liberty. But those who affirm the constitutionality
of the law, base their argument upon technicalities
and upon precedents, and they cannot sustain themselves
for a moment on any other ground. They
found themselves, in the first place, upon the statutory
precedent of 1793, which was an act passed with very
little deliberation, as its history shows, and passed, too,
when it was expected on all hands that slavery would
soon die out. In the next place, they rely upon the
judicial precedent of Prigg’s case, which was made by
a bench of slaveholding judges, and some of the points
which the court professed to decide did not arise in
the case.</p>

<p>Now the statutory precedent covers only a part of
the case; for some of the most hateful features of the
law of 1850 are not to be found in the law of 1793;
and the supreme court has never passed upon the law
of 1850 at all. So two points are clear in the outset,
that the champions of the law cannot get along without<span class="pagenum" id="Page_480">[Pg 480]</span>
the precedents, and the precedents, in several most
important particulars, fail them altogether.<a id="FNanchor_21" href="#Footnote_21" class="fnanchor">[21]</a></p>

<p>This question has lately been discussed in our own
vicinity. The liberty of a resident of Massachusetts,—a
man every way entitled to a jury trial by our constitution
and laws, as much as you or I,—has been
sacrificed by a United States commissioner in the city
of Boston.<a id="FNanchor_22" href="#Footnote_22" class="fnanchor">[22]</a> He has decided in favor of the law.
You would naturally suppose that, in order to shelter
himself from the odium of such a decision, he would
put all personal and all collateral resources into requisition
to make the case as plausible as ingenuity can
make it. It is said, too, that Mr. Webster and Mr.
Webster’s friends, and the commissioner’s friends have
contributed of their strength to help the debility of
the case. While the cause was pending before him,
one of the points involved in it was brought before
the supreme court of Massachusetts, and also before
the circuit court of the United States. The commissioner
adjourned the case over after all the arguments
of counsel were in. He thereby gave himself an opportunity
for preparation and for consultation. I am<span class="pagenum" id="Page_481">[Pg 481]</span>
taking no exception to all this. I am glad it was
done. I suppose we now have the breadth and length
and strength of what can be alleged in favor of the
law. I never feel so confident of my conclusions as
when strong men have taken the opposite side, and
have failed to sustain it.</p>

<p>Now, to this decision of the commissioner, made under
such incitements, and with such opportunities, I propose
to invite your attention. The discussion may be
dry, but it will not be uninteresting; for it involves
matters as important as the liberty of the body and the
liberty of the will, and the liberty and life of the
human soul.</p>

<p>It may be said that these are legal and constitutional
questions, and, therefore, that unprofessional men cannot
understand them. But most, if not all the points
which I shall bring to your attention, are matters of
intuition; questions wholly within the jurisdiction of
plain common sense, and such, therefore, as can be
decided by you as well as by lawyers or judges. And
if I can convince you of the inconclusiveness of some
parts of this decision, of the legal Jesuitism of other
parts, and of the self-contradiction that pervades the
whole, you will not hesitate to set it aside, not as null
and void merely, but as discreditable to the profession
of the law, and dishonorable to the State of Massachusetts.</p>

<p>The first point which the commissioner discusses is,
whether in seizing, by his warrant, a man actually
free, in deciding, by his judgment, the exact question,
whether that man were a slave, and in sending him, by
his certificate, where the lash and the law of slavery
apply to his body and his spirit, he were exercising
“<i>judicial power</i>,” as conferred by the constitution of
the United States upon such courts as <i>Congress</i> should
establish. He at first decides that he does <i>not</i> exercise
such power. This was well; for he knows that he<span class="pagenum" id="Page_482">[Pg 482]</span>
was never appointed, nor commissioned, nor sworn,
nor is paid, nor removable from office for mal-conduct,
as is prescribed by the constitution in the case of
judges. Badly heroic as he was, <i>in fact</i>, in exercising
jurisdiction over a human being, and delivering him
over into hopeless and irremediable bondage, he was
not mad enough to arrogate, <i>in terms</i>, the prerogative
of “<i>judicial power</i>.”</p>

<p>But what says his superior, the attorney-general of
the United States? In an elaborate opinion, given by
order of the President of the United States,—an opinion
which, as I suppose, passed under the supervision
of the whole cabinet, and therefore may be presumed
to have the authority of Mr. Webster and the other
constitutional advisers of the President, and which
certainly had the sanction of the President himself, for
he acted upon it,—in this opinion the attorney-general
says,—</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>“These officers, [the commissioners,] and each of them,
have <i>judicial power</i>, and jurisdiction to hear, examine, and
decide the case.”</p>

<p>“The certificate to be granted to the owner is to be regarded
as the act and <i>judgment</i> of a <i>judicial tribunal</i>, having competent
<i>jurisdiction</i>.”</p>

<p>“Congress has constituted <i>a tribunal</i>, with <i>exclusive jurisdiction</i>
to determine summarily, and without appeal, who are
fugitives from service.”</p>

<p>“The <i>judgment</i> of the <i>tribunal</i>, created by this act, is conclusive
upon all <i>tribunals</i>.”</p>
</div>

<p>Now, which is right, the attorney-general, with the
President and his cabinet as indorsers, or Mr. Commissioner
Curtis? I submit to you that the former
were clearly right, so far as this,—that when the constitution
declares that “no person shall be deprived of
life, liberty, or property, without due process of law,”
(which imports a trial by jury,) then neither Adam
Gibson, nor Thomas Sims, nor any other alleged<span class="pagenum" id="Page_483">[Pg 483]</span>
fugitive can be so deprived, without trial by jury, <i>and
the judgment or sentence of the “judicial power”
thereupon</i>. The following position has never been answered,
and I think never can be, namely, that if a
resident of Massachusetts can be deprived of his “liberty
and property,” without a trial by jury and a judgment
of a <i>court</i>, then he may be deprived of his life
also; for “life, liberty, and property” are secured in
the same section, in the same sentence, and by the
same safeguard.</p>

<p>The attorney-general held that, as the power exercised
by the commissioner was a “judicial power,” it
deprived the party of all benefit from the <i>habeas corpus</i>.
And there was some plausibility in this, though,
I think, no soundness. But our defenders of the law
hold that this sending of a man into bondage is not a
part of the “judicial power,” and yet that it deprives
him of all benefit of the <i>habeas corpus</i>. That is, they
hold that a man may be deprived of his liberty and
property, (and of course of his life,) <i>by a ministerial
proceeding</i>, not having its origin in any court, and not
to be prosecuted to final judgment in any court, and
yet that all the courts in the land, competent to furnish
relief in any other case, can afford none in this. If
this be true, if a proceeding, held and acknowledged
by the officer who initiates and conducts it to be a
ministerial proceeding, not originated by a court, and
never to be carried before a court, does thus take away
the trial by jury, and the security of having one’s liberty
and property adjudicated upon by a “court,” and
renders the writ of <i>habeas corpus</i> an empty form, then,
indeed, we may bid “farewell, a long farewell” to all
our liberties. An unprincipled majority of Congress
has only to pass a law that any man may be imprisoned
or hanged on an executive warrant, and that
the hireling marshal or commissioner shall suffer no
“molestation by any process issued by any court,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_484">[Pg 484]</span>
judge, magistrate, or other person whomsoever,” and
despotic power will be enthroned here as effectually as
it ever was in England in the bloody days of the Stuarts.
Jeffries was at least a judge, though he acted
like a commissioner.</p>

<p>Who could have imagined, eight months ago, that
a <i>ministerial</i> proceeding could put a citizen beyond
remedy or reach of our <i>courts</i>?</p>

<p>I now come to a position in the commissioner’s argument
which is not only transparently fallacious, but
is contradicted by himself, in the same opinion, again
and again. I shall offer a series of objections to it.</p>

<p>The point was pressed upon him by counsel that he
was exercising “judicial power.” To maintain this, a
passage was quoted from Prigg’s case, in which the
court say, “A claim made by the owner out of possession
for the delivery of a slave ... constitutes, in
the strictest sense, a controversy between the parties,
and a case arising under the constitution of the United
States, within the express delegation of judicial power,
given by that instrument.” Can any thing be more
explicit and conclusive, to prove that the commissioner
was then presuming to exercise a part of the “judicial
power” conferred by Congress exclusively upon
courts? And how does he answer it? In this way,
and in this way only. He says the court decide two
points:—</p>

<p>First,—That a claim for a fugitive slave is a case
arising under the constitution of the United States, and
so within the grant of “judicial power” as given by
the constitution; and</p>

<p>Second,—“That being such a case, belonging to
the judicial power of the Union, it was for Congress to
regulate and prescribe the remedy, the form of proceedings,
and the mode and extent in which the judicial
power of the Union should be called into activity.”</p>

<p>He then declares his full admission of <i>both</i> these<span class="pagenum" id="Page_485">[Pg 485]</span>
propositions. And how does he answer the <i>first</i> one,
which, at a blow, unseats him from his usurped bench?
He says, “The counsel for the prisoner have insisted
most strenuously on the first of these positions, but
have said nothing with regard to the second.” And
what need had the counsel to say any thing about the
second, <i>the first being admitted</i>? The supreme court
had said, and he acknowledged it, that every case like
the one then before him was a “case arising under the
constitution of the United States, within the express
delegation of judicial power given by that instrument.”
This was equivalent to saying that it was a case which
could not be adjudicated upon by a commissioner, because
a commissioner is not a judge,—is no court nor
part of a court. The plain statement of the commissioner’s
language is this: The supreme court declare
that I have no jurisdiction in this case; but because
the counsel said nothing about another point to be
found in the opinion of the court, therefore I will take
jurisdiction.</p>

<p>But again; this reply of the commissioner, that the
counsel said nothing about the second point, (when he
had acknowledged the validity of the first, which was
fatal,) is not merely an evasion; it is founded upon a
false meaning attributed by him to the second point.
He says the court held that it was “for Congress to
regulate and prescribe the remedy, the form of proceedings,
and the mode and extent in which the judicial
power of the Union should be called into activity.”
Suppose it was for Congress to do this. Might they
not transcend their power when doing it? and does
not his admission of the first point prove that they
have transcended their power?—the very point then
in question. The two things cannot stand together.
If the trial of the issue, “fugitive slave or not,” be, “in
the strictest sense,” “within the express delegation of
judicial power given” by the constitution, then this<span class="pagenum" id="Page_486">[Pg 486]</span>
ministerial commissioner cannot exercise it, and Congress
cannot empower him to exercise it. Besides, the
decision of the court was made in 1842. The law,
whose constitutionality they had then under discussion,
was passed in 1850. Did the court in ’42 declare,
or could they declare, that any law <i>thereafter</i>
passed by Congress on this subject should be held constitutional?
Did their decision act prospectively, and
adjudge a law to be constitutional, which was to be
passed eight years afterwards? So far from this, the
points then under discussion,—namely, the power of
a commissioner to adjudge a case more important than
life or death, and the obligation of a commissioner to
hear <i>ex parte</i> evidence, and to be concluded by it when
heard,—these questions did not come before the supreme
court in ’42, and have never been before the
supreme court at all. But because that court had said,
years before, that it belongs to Congress to prescribe
the mode of recovering fugitive slaves, <i>therefore</i>, says
the commissioner, if Congress should vest this power
in commissioners, (and in slave traders or pirates just
as well,) it would be valid. And because the counsel
did not answer this point, the commissioner decides
an admitted point, conclusive in their favor, against
them.</p>

<p>But this is not all. After declaring, in the first part
of the opinion, his full conviction that the delivery of
an alleged fugitive comes within “the express delegation
of judicial power,” he uses, farther on, the following
language: “It would seem,” says he, “that it only
remains to inquire whether the act of 1850 authorizes
or requires any thing more than a summary ministerial
proceeding in aid of the right secured by the constitution,
namely, the right of removal.” And he holds
that it does not. The act which, in the first part of
the opinion, was acknowledged to belong, “in the
strictest sense,” to the “judicial power,” has now<span class="pagenum" id="Page_487">[Pg 487]</span>
ceased to be “<i>any thing more</i> than a summary ministerial
proceeding.”</p>

<p>And again he says, “I have endeavored, in the foregoing
discussion, to show that this is a summary ministerial
proceeding,” &amp;c. “If this be so, <i>and I can
entertain no doubt that it is</i>,” &amp;c. This sudden transmigration
from a judge to an executioner, from one
who acknowledged that the delivery of an alleged
fugitive is an act of “judicial power,” to one who
holds that it is <span class="allsmcap">NOT</span> “<i>any thing more</i> than a summary
ministerial proceeding,” may suit a disciple of Pythagoras,
or the priests of the Hindoo religion, but it ill
becomes an expounder of American jurisprudence.</p>

<p>I proceed to another point in the commissioner’s
decision, namely, the nature and authority of “judicial
power;” and when I have discussed it, I shall
submit to your good sense whether I do him any injustice
in saying that it is most perspicuously fallacious
and lucidly absurd.</p>

<p>“In all governments formed upon the English
model,” says he, “there is a certain class of inquiries,
[powers?] judicial in their nature, but which are confided
to officers not constituting a part of the judiciary,
strictly so called.” (I do not like this substitution of
the word “inquiries” for “powers.” If any thing
under heaven should be called a <i>power</i>, the prerogative
of sending a human being, presumptively free, into
bondage, is surely one.) He then instances certain
officers in Great Britain, who, though not judges, perform,
as he says, certain judicial functions. A brief
remark will suffice for this. Great Britain, having no
written constitution, the current of its legislative enactments
and its judicial decisions makes its constitution.
If, then, it has been the prevailing practice of that government
to confer any given description of powers upon
any given class of officers, then that is what the British
constitution allows and approves.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_488">[Pg 488]</span></p>

<p>But we have a written constitution, and therefore
are not to tolerate a law, (as in the case of this Fugitive
Slave law,) which is repugnant to its fundamental
provisions. By this constitution, all legislative powers
therein granted are vested in Congress; executive
power in a President, and judicial power in the courts.
The constitution of Massachusetts is equally explicit.
It says, “In the government of this commonwealth the
legislative department shall never exercise the executive
and judicial powers, or either of them; the executive
shall never exercise the legislative and judicial
powers, or either of them; the judicial shall never exercise
the legislative and executive powers, or either
of them; to the end it may be a government of laws,
and not of men.”</p>

<p>In both these constitutions, the three functions of
government, namely, to legislate, to adjudicate, and to
execute, are expressly recognized; and the <i>whole</i> of
their distinctive powers are lodged in separate departments.
No mention is made of any hybrid or mongrel
class, half judicial and half executive, or half ministerial
and half judicial, or compounded of aliquot parts
of each. Such an officer, under either constitution,
would be a monster; he would hold the same relation
to their legitimate functionaries that Caliban does to
the human race; and, if created for executing the Fugitive
Slave law, that half devil and half beast would
be the fitting prototype.</p>

<p>The commissioner professes to have found a class
of cases, both under our state and national constitutions,
where powers, “judicial in their nature, and
special in their purpose, may be confided to the determination
of officers who are not judges.” On this
point he has expended himself. Here lay the pressure
and travail of his case. Seeing that, in deciding the
great issue before him, “slave or free,” he was exercising
judicial power, and in ordering an armed force<span class="pagenum" id="Page_489">[Pg 489]</span>
to convoy the victim to his house of bondage he was
exercising ministerial or executive power, (thus blending
the functions which both constitutions have separated,)
the commissioner felt that he must find some
analogy or some precedent to cover up this obvious
violation of all principle, or his argument was in ruins.
It is in ruins; for he has found no such precedent, and
cannot find any.</p>

<p>The instances he cites from Massachusetts are,—1.
Sheriffs, who may preside over juries when assessing
damages for laying out highways, and may decide such
questions of law as arise on the trial; 2. Auditors,
who may examine vouchers and state accounts between
parties, and make report thereof to the court;
3. Commissioners of insolvency, appointed to distribute
insolvent estates; and, 4. County commissioners,
who lay out highways.</p>

<p>Now, nothing can be clearer than that, in no one of
these cases does the officer named exercise “judicial
power.” Indisputably, universally, and necessarily, by
force of the phrase itself, the term “judicial power”
embraces the idea of a <i>power</i> whose decision can be
enforced <i>in invitum</i>; that is, against an unwilling,
contesting, resisting party. The sublime power of a
court becomes nothingness, and is ridiculous, if its decrees
cannot be executed to the very death of the party
against whom they are made. For this purpose, they
are backed by all the civil power of the state; and
should this prove insufficient, they are backed by all
the military power of the state; and, even beyond
this, by the whole military and naval power of the
United States. Without this, judges are but puppets,
or no better than “men in buckram.” “Judicial power”
does not consist in a sheriff’s presiding over a jury,
nor in an auditor’s casting up accounts, nor in a commissioner’s
ciphering out the dividends of an insolvent’s
estate, nor in county commissioners’ laying out<span class="pagenum" id="Page_490">[Pg 490]</span>
roads; but it consists in entering up a judgment which
has the armories at Springfield and Harper’s Ferry,
which has the standing army and militia of the United
States, which has fifty line-of-battle ships, which has
the treasury of the nation, to back it, and to visit with
death one man, a thousand men, or a hundred thousand
men, if need be, who shall confront it with resistance.</p>

<p>Look, fellow-citizens, at this wretched sophistry.
The sheriff must make return of the verdict of the
jury to the court of common pleas,—<i>which is a</i>
<span class="allsmcap">COURT</span>,—and if either party suggests good grounds of
dissatisfaction, the whole proceeding is a nullity, and
the investigation must be made again; and again and
again, and ten times again, until every act and letter
of it become unexceptionable. The auditor must
make his report to the court that appointed him, and
if the court see cause, they set aside both it and him.
The acts of the commissioners of insolvency derive
all their validity from the consent of the parties, or
from the judgment of a court, which substitutes the
force of law for consent. And no act of the county
commissioners, in taking a man’s land, is worth the
paper it is written on, until the verdict of the jury is
returned to the <i>court</i> of common pleas, and there formally
accepted and recorded. Nay, every intelligent
farmer in the country knows the fact, that though the
commissioners have laid out a new road, or ordered an
old one to be shut up, still, if a party, feeling himself
aggrieved, demands a jury, the former cannot be worked,
nor the latter closed, until the <i>court</i> of common pleas
shall have passed upon the proceeding and ratified it.<a id="FNanchor_23" href="#Footnote_23" class="fnanchor">[23]</a></p>
<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_491">[Pg 491]</span></p>
<p>If, however, in all the above cases, the parties in interest
<i>consent</i> to the acts of sheriff, auditor, or commissioner,
then those acts become binding, by virtue of
such consent. The party consenting is afterwards
estopped from questioning them. But they derive no
authority from any “judicial power” vested in the
officers performing them. We have a case more exactly
in point, and better illustrating the principle, in
the fourth section of the ninety-seventh chapter of our
Revised Statutes, where it is provided, that “in actions
upon promissory notes and other contracts, where the
amount due appears to be undisputed, the debt or damages
may be assessed and ascertained by the clerk,
either under a general order of the court, or by a special
reference of the case to him; and the judgment, in
either case, shall be entered in the same form as if it
had been awarded by the court, on an assessment or
computation made by themselves.” Yet who will
pretend that this act of the clerk, which is performed
only where there is no dispute between the parties,
emanates from any “judicial power” in that officer?</p>

<p>The instances cited under the United States constitution
have, if possible, still less plausibility. The
commissioners appointed by the courts can initiate
certain proceedings, by holding parties to trial, &amp;c., but
this function is no more <i>judicial</i> than that of the grand
jury in finding an indictment. It is a preliminary to
a judicial act, but not such an act. The commissioners
are not even required to be sworn, and, in many
instances, it is known they are not sworn.</p>

<p>So of the case of which so much is attempted to be
made,—that of the commissioner of patents. Any
party feeling himself aggrieved by any of his decisions
can appeal directly to the courts of the United States
for redress.</p>

<p>Compare all this with analogous instances in the
legislative department of government. The legislatures<span class="pagenum" id="Page_492">[Pg 492]</span>
of most of the states have created commissions to
revise their codes of statute law. Massachusetts has
had several such. Our revised statutes are a monument
of the labor of one of these commissions. But
were they legislators? <i>Was their proposed code of any
validity until enacted by the Senate and House of
Representatives?</i> Just as much as the acts of sheriff,
auditor, or commissioners of the different kinds, were
acts of judicial power, and no more. Are the selectmen
of our towns legislators, because they decide, in
the first instance, who are elected as members of our
House of Representatives? Are our governor and
council legislators, in both the state and national governments,
because, on an examination of votes transmitted
to them by the selectmen, they issue certificates
of election to our state senators and to the members of
Congress elect? Do they exercise any part of that
power which makes “each house the judge of the
elections, returns, and qualification of its own members”?
Just as much, I reply, as sheriff, auditor,
commissioner, or clerk, does of “judicial power.”
They perform acts preliminary or antecedent to legislation,
but no legislative act; just as the above-named
classes of officers perform acts preliminary or antecedent
to judicial decisions, but never, in any case, the
authoritative and compulsory judicial act itself.</p>

<p>The strength, or rather, the weakness, of the commissioner’s
argument, on this point, consists in the
obtrusive, projecting, self-shouting fallacy of using
the exact, technical, constitutional phrase, “judicial
power,” as synonymous with the popular expression,
“<i>a judicious act</i>,” or “<i>the exercise of judgment</i>.”
Officers of all kinds exercise “judicial power,” in this
broad and popular sense of the phrase; that is, they
perform acts requiring good judgment. Umpires, arbitrators,
and referees perform acts precisely like those
of judges, but they cannot put the whole physical<span class="pagenum" id="Page_493">[Pg 493]</span>
strength of the government in motion to enforce them.
So sheriffs decide upon the identity of the party named
in their precepts; postmasters, to whom they shall deliver
letters, and what postage they shall demand; custom-house
officers, upon the nature and value of dutiable
goods; assessors, in levying taxes; parents and
teachers, on matters of discipline, &amp;c., &amp;c. In a popular
sense, they may all be said to exercise judicial
power; but no particle of that power which, by the
fundamental law of our government, is vested in the
“courts.” Their acts are all examinable by the courts.
They cannot set the arm of the government in motion
to execute their judgments. Indeed, the whole argument
of the commissioner on this point is but a play
upon words. It is only a trick of verbal legerdemain.
The premises he starts with are unknown to the constitution,
and the conclusion he comes to is abhorrent
to humanity.</p>

<p>Does not every body see that, in order to make the
cases parallel, in order to obtain any legitimate ground
of comparison between them, Sims should have had
the same power of appealing from the commissioner’s
decision, to a court, which power of appeal belongs
<i>of right</i> to a party who feels aggrieved by the act of
sheriff, auditor, or commissioner; and that the certificate
should bind him only by his voluntary assent?</p>

<p>But there is another point in the commissioner’s
opinion which is worthy to be companion to this. I
proceed to consider it.</p>

<p>He repeats, and keeps repeating, that his decision,
dooming Sims to all the horrors of bondage, and putting
him under the control of a man who claims title
to his body and his soul, to be carried into a jurisdiction
where such titles are acknowledged, is not
“<span class="allsmcap">FINAL</span>.” It is not <i>final</i>, he says, because if Sims be
free, he may extort that freedom from the laws of
Georgia which has been denied to him by the laws of<span class="pagenum" id="Page_494">[Pg 494]</span>
Massachusetts; that is, if the judgment which the
commissioner is giving against a free man, in a free
state, is a false judgment, he may go to a slave state
to obtain redress,—which is ten thousand times worse
than if a jury, in a capital case, should say, We may find
this prisoner guilty; for if he be wrongfully hanged,
God will make him amends.</p>

<p>Besides the inhumanity of this position, it contains
a fallacy which is twin-brother to the one just considered.
The judicial word, “<i>final</i>,” has a legal, technical,
and certain meaning. In the courts, and in the
law books, it means the last judgment in a judicial
proceeding. It means that judgment from which a
party cannot appeal, though he may ever so much desire
it; or it means that judgment, after which, however
dissatisfied the party may be, he cannot have his
cause retried or reheard by a court, <i>but is compelled to
submit</i>.</p>

<p>“Final judgments,” says Blackstone, “are such as
at once put an end to the action.” This is a precise
description of the judgment rendered by the commissioner
against Sims. That victim resisted by prayers
and tears, by the subduing eloquence of his counsel,
and by their irresistible logic, which the commissioner
has never yet begun to answer. But the self-constituted
judge was inexorable. Though he knew that,
according to the terms of the Fugitive Law, there was
no escape from his decision; though he knew that his
certificate was to protect the man-hunter from all “molestation
by any process issued by any court, judge,
magistrate, or other person whomsoever,” yet, like
Pilate, he washes his hands and says, “I am innocent
of this man’s blood, see ye to it;” for my decision is
not “final.” And why? Because, in another jurisdiction,
in another suit, where the plaintiff is to be
defendant, and the defendant plaintiff, or perhaps
against another party; in a place, too, where all the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_495">[Pg 495]</span>
common-law presumptions in favor of freedom are reversed;
where the law is different, and the rules of
evidence are different; and where the respondent himself
is reduced to the condition of a chattel and a brute,
a decision, at some indefinite future period, may be had
that the man, whom the commissioner now declares to
be a slave, is free, and has always been so. Because
of this future and contingent event, because of this almost
impossible possibility, the commissioner’s decision
is not <i>final</i>. I deny this. The decision is <i>final</i>, because,
as Blackstone says, it “at once puts an end to
the action.” But let us test the question, not only by
its legal definition, but by its actual effects. It decides
that Sims is a slave. It decides that he owes service
to James Potter. It decides that Potter and his heirs
and assigns forever are the lawful owners of Sims and
the heirs of his bondage forever; and when Sims and
his posterity shall be scourged, torn, flayed, mutilated,
starved, the only consolation which the commissioner
has for him and them is, Shall the clay say to the
<i>Potter</i> that fashioneth it, What makest thou? It not
only decides that Sims is a slave, and that he shall be
sent to Georgia, but it sends <i>familiars</i>, like those which
once disgraced even the purlieus of the Inquisition, to
see that the devilish deed is done.</p>

<p>The whole argument of the commissioner, that this
act of his is not <i>final</i>, is founded on a quibble,—on
the use of the legal word “final,” as though it were
synonymous with the popular word <i>eternal</i> or <i>perpetual</i>.
The slavery of Sims may not be <i>eternal</i> or <i>perpetual</i>;
because, by some miracle of God, or otherwise, he may
escape. But in a technical and juridical sense the decision
of the commissioner is <i>final</i>; and he might as
well doom a man to be hurled from the Tarpeian rock,
and say that the act is not final, because he only commits
the victim to the laws of gravitation, as he has
committed Sims to the laws of Georgia.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_496">[Pg 496]</span></p>

<p>If by any possibility this doctrine, that the decision
is not <i>final</i>, could be for a moment sustained, then I
will submit a case with which to compare it.</p>

<p>The constitution says, “No state shall pass any law
impairing the obligation of contracts.” Here we have
a constitutional basis,—the same as for the reclamation
of fugitive slaves. Some states have passed laws
impairing the obligation of contracts, as the stop-laws
of Kentucky, and so forth. Suppose a Massachusetts
creditor to claim to have a Kentucky debtor, whose
contract has been so impaired. Could Congress, in
order to give efficacy to this constitutional provision,
authorize this pretended creditor to go to Kentucky,
seize enough of the alleged debtor’s property to satisfy
the alleged debt, and carry it home, or have it ordered
home by a magistrate, under some “summary” process,
which, on its face, excludes the trial by jury;
and thereby debar the supposed defendant of all right
under that provision of the constitution which gives a
jury trial when the value in controversy exceeds
twenty dollars? And could the Kentucky magistrate,
in the supposed case, deny the jury trial on the ground
that the proceeding before him was not “final,” because
the defendant might follow the plaintiff to Massachusetts,
and there institute an action of replevin,
trespass, or trover, to try, before a jury of the country,
the right of the former plaintiff to the property he had
seized?</p>

<p>The commissioner says much in different places,
with the apparent hope of showing that the proceeding
before him was only for what he calls a “limited and
special purpose,” namely, “<i>removal</i>.”</p>

<p>I confess myself unable to understand why the certificate
of the commissioner is any more restricted to a
limited and special purpose than any judicial act, sentence,
or execution, of any court whatever. The commissioner
declares a <i>prima facie</i> freeman to be a slave.<span class="pagenum" id="Page_497">[Pg 497]</span>
He declares that James Potter owns Thomas Sims,
and the posterity in his loins forever; or that Thomas
Sims and his posterity forever, owe service to James
Potter and his heirs and assigns forever. Does this
“<i>forever</i>” limit the meaning of the certificate, as to
time? If so, then a <i>general</i> or <i>unlimited</i> award or
execution, against Sims, as contradistinguished from
this <i>limited</i> and <i>special</i> one, must extend and run into
the next world. When our courts decide that one
man owes another man money, they award execution
against his property, with certain humane exemptions
as to clothes, furniture, provisions, school books, Bible,
&amp;c. But when this commissioner decided that Sims
owed Potter service, he awarded a certificate against
the adjudged debtor, which made no exemption whatever;
but included property, clothes, books, skin,
flesh, heart, brain, soul, and all that was in him, or of
him, with all appurtenances and appendages, present
emblements, and future increase. Yet, according to
the commissioner, the first judgment is a common or
general one; the last “special and limited.” Under
our old laws, (and under the laws of some states yet,)
courts could sentence offenders to the barbarous punishment
of flogging. But they were and are bound
to specify the number of lashes. This is general.
The commissioner delivers over a slave to be flogged
by his master, <i>ad libitum</i>, and <i>in perpetuum</i>, to be
flogged in his own person, and to be flogged in the
persons of his children, and their posterity, <i>in secula
seculorum</i>. The defined flogging of thirty-nine, or
such other number of lashes as can be computed, the
commissioner calls general or indefinite. But the
incomputable number of lashes; the vast, unknown,
algebraic quantity; the infinite series; that which
Newton with all his mathematics could not compass,
nor Rosse with his telescope see the end of,—that is
“special and limited.” The taking of a limited<span class="pagenum" id="Page_498">[Pg 498]</span>
amount of a man’s property, carefully set down in
dollars and cents, both in the text and in the margin
of the execution, the commissioner calls a general
purpose. But the robbing of a man, not only of all
he has earned, but of all his capabilities of earning as
long as he breathes, with full authority to do the same
thing to his posterity to the latest generation, this is
“special and limited.” To sentence a man to be
hanged by the neck till he be dead, though with
privilege of priest, prayer book, and Bible,—this, too,
is general and proper; though in Massachusetts it can
be done only by a majority of the judges of the
supreme court. But to send a man to be worked to
death in five years on a sugar plantation, where his
being taught to read the gospel of Jesus Christ is a
felony,—this is “special and limited,” and so may be
done by any hireling commissioner who will do what
Judas did for one third part of his silver pieces.</p>

<p>Fellow-citizens, I submit to any man, clerical, legal,
or lay, who is capable of appreciating moral distinctions,
whether this whole doctrine, about delivering a
man up as a slave, and putting him bodily into the
hands of the claimant, and thrusting him into slave
jurisdiction, under the pretext that it is done only for
<i>the special and limited purpose of removal</i>, be not
atrocious. It is more like a forgery than an argument.
Assumed learning and logic never practised a greater
imposition upon themselves, nor attempted a greater
one upon others, than when they fabricated this notion,
that adjudging a man to be a slave, stripping him
of his <i>liberam legem</i>, that is, of all his rights and
immunities as a citizen, and delivering him into actual
bondage, is “for a special and limited purpose of
removal,”—only to give him a voyage, or a pleasure
excursion of a few hundred miles,—<i>out,—but not
back</i>. When the successor of St. Peter, claiming to
hold the keys of heaven, and to have death and hell<span class="pagenum" id="Page_499">[Pg 499]</span>
for his ministers, excommunicated whole sects and
peoples, and delivered them over to the great soul-hunter,
and sent his <i>familiars</i> with them to see that
the “claimant” suffered no “molestation” while conveying
them to the bottomless pit, <i>he</i> might as well
have said that he did it only for a “special and limited
purpose.” It was not damnation, it was only “removal.”
And do you suppose the devil, could he
have got possession of those outcast souls, would have
cared any more under what pretence the great pontiff
commissioner made the delivery, than does the southern
slaveholder, when he gets possession of a man of
whom he can make a slave?</p>

<p>This fallacy about the “special and limited purpose
of removal” did not originate with Mr. Commissioner
Curtis. I exculpate him from that guilt. He only
adopted it and gave it a “bad eminence” by making
it, in part, the basis of his decision. But henceforth
let the people brand it. Let them classify it and denounce
it, and detest it, as belonging to that impious
and blasphemous kind of arguments by which our first
parents were beguiled, when Satan told them that,
though they sinned against God, they should not
die; or by which Mr. Webster cajoled and cozened
so many honest men, when he assured them, that
though they should violate the moral law, by opening
all the territories to slavery, yet some physical law of
geography or the weather would avert the penalties.</p>

<p>In the absence of all decent materials for an argument,
the commissioner resorts to that ten times exploded position,
that there is an analogy between fugitives from
justice and fugitives from service. Where could he
find a bandage of prejudice thick enough to blind him
to the distinction, that the condition of delivering up
the former is that he be <i>charged</i> with crime, while the
condition of delivering up the latter is that he be <i>held</i>
to labor, and that he <i>owes</i> service? How can it be<span class="pagenum" id="Page_500">[Pg 500]</span>
said that a man <i>owes</i> service, until the <i>fact</i> of the
<i>indebtedness</i> be proved? Such reasonable suspicion
of guilt as justifies a grand jury in finding a bill of
indictment is sufficient in the one case, but such positive
proof as would require the court to enter up judgment
and award execution is absolutely necessary in
the other. The government demanding a fugitive
from justice seeks possession of him for a trial, <i>before
a court and jury</i>, of the question of <i>criminality</i>; but
the claimant of an alleged fugitive from service seeks
possession of him to avoid a trial, <i>before a court and
jury</i>, of the question of <i>freedom</i>. The constitution
requires that every person accused of crime shall be
tried in the state and district where the crime shall
be charged to have been committed; but it makes no
such provision in regard to the alleged fugitive from
service; and this injunction in the one case, and
omission in the other, create the irresistible inference,
that there is a difference between them, and that the
alleged fugitive from service, according to all the analogies
of the common law, is to be tried where he is found.</p>

<p>But there is one distinction which is broad enough
and luminous enough to make a blind man see it. An
alleged fugitive from justice is not adjudged to be a
criminal previous to delivery, nor is he made a criminal,
in the eye of the law, by the act of delivery.
But the alleged fugitive from service is adjudged a
slave, and made a slave by the certificate of the commissioner.
The state receiving a fugitive from justice
does not proceed forthwith to punish him. But the
receiver of an alleged fugitive from service <i>owns</i> him,
and may proceed to control him, and beat him, and rob
him, and starve him, on the very instant that the
commissioner puts the certificate into his hands. If
any one cannot see this distinction, no act of the
moral oculist can give him sight.</p>

<p>The papers inform us that when Sims was landed<span class="pagenum" id="Page_501">[Pg 501]</span>
in Savannah, he was taken to jail and received the
“<i>usual reprimand</i>,” which, as every body knows, is
a flayed and blood-streaming back. By whose certificate
was the nine-thonged cat laid on? Had he been
a murderer or a pirate, would excoriation have been
the first act of welcome on his arrival? No! Murderers
and pirates would have had a jury. The law
is beneficent to them; it saves its terrors for the slave.
A man who will not <i>see</i> such a distinction as this,
would excite no pity should he be made to <i>feel</i> it.</p>

<p>In treating this topic, the commissioner makes one
assertion that seems insane. He says that, to authorize
the delivery of a fugitive from justice, in order to his
removal, “<i>it must be proved that he has committed a
crime</i>.” Such a declaration was never made before,
and I do not believe it will be ever made again. You
could not find a lawyer south of Mason and Dixon’s
who would venture to say this. Every body
knows that the supposed criminal needs only <i>to be
charged</i> with crime. It is the alleged slave who must
be proved to <i>be held</i> to service before he can be constitutionally
surrendered. But as though this was not
absurd enough, the commissioner goes on to say, that
though the alleged fugitive from justice must be
proved, in the place where he is taken, “to have
committed a crime,” yet, after his removal, he must
be proved again to have committed it. How can a
man be proved, in any legal way, to have committed
a crime, without being confronted with the witnesses
against him? Why, after having been so proved, is
he put upon trial again?</p>

<p>As to all the commissioner says in denial of the
right of trial by jury, I shall make but one or two
remarks. I have argued that question elsewhere;
and, until I see some answer to that argument, I have
no occasion for repetition or corroboration of it. After
using the word “<i>person</i>” some twenty times, to signify<span class="pagenum" id="Page_502">[Pg 502]</span>
the President of the United States, electors, senators,
representatives, United States officers, Indians,
Africans, &amp;c., the constitution declares that “no <i>person</i>
shall be deprived of life, liberty, or property,
without due process of law;”—this “due process of
law” meaning trial by jury. This is one fact. Adam
Gibson, Henry Long, Thomas Sims, and many others,
some of them now acknowledged on all hands to have
been free, have been sent into slavery without this
trial. This is another fact. Now put these two facts
together. No man shall be deprived of liberty or
property, except by the jury trial. These men have
been deprived of liberty and property without the
jury trial. These are the two ends. Now fill up the
space between them with what you please, and call it
argument, law, gospel, or what you will, every body
must see that it is nothing, and can be nothing but
Mephistophiles’ jugglery. I dismiss this point with a
single proposition: In Massachusetts, we know no
legal distinction founded on color. Through all the
gradations, from the person who has the preternatural
whiteness of an Albino to one whom you can see in the
darkest midnight, because he is so solid black,—all,
<i>all</i>, under our constitution and laws, are alike freemen,
or alike slaves. Notwithstanding the commissioner’s
decision makes us all slaves, yet I maintain that, in
the eye of the law, we are all free. How then can
any one of us freemen be robbed of liberty and property,
and turned into a slave, but by freeman’s proof,—that
is, trial by jury? I acknowledge that after
we have been proved to be slaves by freeman’s proof,
then all the unutterable consequences of slavery follow,
of course; just as when a man has been proved
to be a murderer, the consequences of murder follow.
But <span class="allsmcap">UNTIL</span>, mark this, <b>UNTIL</b> a man has been proved
to be a slave by freeman’s proof, he remains legally
free. And a magistrate who takes jurisdiction of a<span class="pagenum" id="Page_503">[Pg 503]</span>
proceeding by which a man may be deprived of liberty
or property, without freeman’s proof, prejudges his victim,
when he allows the first witness to be called, or the
first paper to be read; and he might just as well do
it, in a case of “life,” as in a case of “liberty and
property.”</p>

<p>The next position of the commissioner which I
shall notice relates to the right of Congress to make
use of state courts to execute United States laws.</p>

<p>Now we have the express authority of the supreme
court of the United States for saying that “Congress
cannot vest any portion of the judicial power of the
United States, except in courts ordained and established
by itself.”—<i>Martin</i> vs. <i>Hunter’s Lessee</i>, 1
Wheaton, 330. “The whole judicial power of the
United States should be, at all times, vested in some
courts created under its authority.”—<i>Ib.</i> 331. “The
jurisdiction over such cases, [cases arising under the
constitution, laws, and treaties of the United States,]
could not exist in the state courts previous to the
adoption of the constitution, and it could not afterwards
be directly conferred on them; for the constitution
expressly requires the judicial power to be
vested in courts ordained and established by the United
States.”—<i>Ib.</i> 335. But the commissioner refers to a
passage in Prigg’s case, in which it is said that “while
a difference of opinion exists ... whether state
magistrates are bound to act under it, [a law of Congress,]
none is entertained by the court, that state
magistrates may, if they choose, exercise the authority,
unless prohibited by state legislation.”</p>

<p>Waiving all exceptions to this doctrine, the utmost
that can be made of it is this: that state magistrates
may execute a law of Congress, unless forbidden by a
law of their state; but when so forbidden, they cannot;
and Congress can neither compel them to do so,
nor annul a prohibitory law of the state, by giving<span class="pagenum" id="Page_504">[Pg 504]</span>
validity to the act of the magistrate, performed in
violation of the state law. Now mark the <i>non sequitur</i>
of the commissioner’s logic. See how his
premises belong to one subject, and his conclusion to
another. Because a <i>Massachusetts</i> magistrate may
execute a law of Congress, unless the Massachusetts
legislature forbid him, but if so forbidden he can no
longer do it, therefore, when the Massachusetts legislature
has so forbidden him, Congress may send the
magistrates of Georgia, or of any other state, into Massachusetts,
to do what our own state had forbidden our
own magistrates to do. I say “<i>send the magistrates
of Georgia here</i>;” because Congress may just as well,
and even better for us, authorize the magistrates of
any state in the Union to come here, set up courts,
and pass sentences which shall convey our citizens
into bondage, as to stay at home and make records,
which, when brought here, shall have the same effect.
This, then, is the law-logic of the commissioner: Because
a Massachusetts magistrate may aid in reclaiming
an alleged fugitive on Massachusetts ground,
unless forbidden by his state, yet, if so forbidden, then
the legislatures of fifteen slave states may send their
magistrates, or the acts of their magistrates here, to do
the same thing. The state might prevent its own
magistrates from aiding in this nefarious work, but
this would be of no avail, for any one, or all, of fifteen
sets of slave state magistrates may come and do
the forbidden act.</p>

<p>Pierpont Edwards once said of a clergyman, that if
his text had a contagious disease, the sermon would
not catch it; and a blind man, being asked to describe
his conception of color, compared it to a clap of thunder.
But all their ideas were coherent and homogeneous
compared with those premises and conclusions
of the commissioner, by which the State Rights’ doctrine
is expounded to mean, the right of one <i>state</i> to<span class="pagenum" id="Page_505">[Pg 505]</span>
send its magistrates into another state, to do what the
latter has <i>lawfully</i> prohibited its own magistrates from
doing. South Carolina never claimed so much as this.</p>

<p>Under the first head, where it had been urged by
counsel, that a freeman might have no opportunity to
prove his freedom in the state from which he was alleged
to have fled, because the claimant was under no
obligation to carry him to that state, but might send
him to the Cuban or Brazilian market, the commissioner
shuts his eyes to these very probable consequences,
and refuses to consider them; but under the fifth head,
where an argument in favor of the slaveholder could
be derived from consequences, he not only argues elaborately
from them, but bases his judgment upon them.</p>

<p>There are two remarks thrown out in the course of
the commissioner’s opinion so shocking to every feeling
of humanity, that any one, in commenting upon
them, may well be excused for passing from the language
of argument to that of emotion.</p>

<p>If there be any one right known to the common law
more important and sacred than all others, it is the
right of confronting and cross-examining the witnesses
who are brought to testify against us. Without this
right, there is no fraud that cannot be practised upon
the most honest man, and no guilt that cannot be
proved against the most innocent one. Doubtless this
right of cross-examination is sometimes abused; but
there are few spectacles more exciting or more gratifying
than to see the demons of falsehood driven out,
one after another, from a perjured villain, until the
truth, at last, is wrenched from his heart, notwithstanding
the double boltings and barrings with which he
had locked it there. The fear of this cross-examination
“casting its shadows before,” has prevented thousands
and tens of thousands from swearing falsely.
Next to honesty, this fear is the greatest protection to
property, liberty, and life.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_506">[Pg 506]</span></p>

<p>Now the testimony which doomed Sims to slavery,
and which may doom any of us with our wives and
children to slavery, when men grow, not more wicked,
but only a little more bold in their wickedness than
they are now, was wholly <i>ex parte</i> testimony; taken,
not merely behind the victim’s back, but a thousand
miles behind his back; of which he had no
knowledge, and, unless he were omniscient, like God,
could have no knowledge. And when the counsel of
Sims urged upon the commissioner the enormity of
this outrage against all principle, what was his reply?
It was this, and it makes a man’s blood run cold to
read it: Sims’s absence from Georgia, “so that he
could not be served with notice, if he was entitled to
it, was in his own wrong, and he cannot now complain
that he had no opportunity to cross-examine the
witnesses.”</p>

<p>I appeal to all history to prove, that no judge who
ever sat upon a bench where the common law was
recognized and administered, however corrupt he may
have been, ever advanced a more atrocious doctrine.
Why, gentlemen, if a debtor absconds for the very
purpose of defrauding his creditors, he must have notice
before he can be proceeded against for the recovery
of a debt. If he flees from the state, lurks and
hides himself, he must have the best notice the court
can contrive to give him. If the plaintiff recovers and
takes out execution, he must file a bond conditioned to
make restoration; and years afterwards, if the defendant
shall come back and show cause; he shall be entitled
to a review to annul the whole proceedings
against him. Ay, when a criminal, a robber, a murderer,
an incendiary, is brought to trial, even he must
be “confronted with the witnesses against him, have
compulsory process for obtaining witnesses in his favor,
and the assistance of counsel in his defence.” And
yet the commissioner <i>makes proof out of nothing</i>, that<span class="pagenum" id="Page_507">[Pg 507]</span>
Sims escaped from slavery, and then, because of this
nothing-made proof, he inculpates him with being absent
“in his own wrong.”</p>

<p>The other point referred to arose from certain testimony,
(if it can be called testimony,) that the mother
of Sims begged the witness, “whether her son was in
a free state or in a slave state, for God’s sake, to bring
him back again.” “This,” says the commissioner,
“certainly disarms the case of any unpleasant features”!
Why, even the kine of the barn-yard, when
the butcher cuts the throat of her young, will weep
and low, and bellow, for days and days, and say, as
well as in her inarticulate moanings she can say, “For
God’s sake, let it be brought back again;” though the
only consequence of its return would be to have its
throat cut by the butcher again. And are we to expect
that the brutalized, chattelized “cattle” of the
south will have less of that natural yearning and longing
of the soul, at the loss of their offspring, than the
animals of the farmer’s yard? Can we suppose that
God has not planted the instinct of a mother’s love
too deep to be destroyed but by the destruction of the
being herself in whom it was planted? No! debase
the mother as you will, by ignorance, vice, superstition,
lust, concubinage, incest, and this wealth of affection
will still glow at the bottom of her heart, “rich as the
oozy bottom of the deep in sunken wrack and sumless
treasures.” And because this mother’s love had not
been all extinguished, the commissioner says that his
sending a human being into the abyss of bondage, on
evidence that an intelligent barbarian would reject,
“certainly disarms the case of any unpleasant features.”
But I shall not expostulate with the commissioner.
A man must have a heart before he can feel,
as he must have eyes before he can see.</p>

<p>Fellow-citizens, I might occupy your attention much
longer upon this unprecedented opinion of the commissioner;
but there are two or three other topics to
which I wish to call your attention, and I therefore
forbear. In saying what I have said, I disclaim all
personal ill will or discourtesy towards that magistrate.
Even should I appear not to have succeeded in suppressing
my own feelings, I certainly cannot wound
his more than he has wounded mine, and those I believe
of nine tenths of all who have ever read his
opinion;—not by a thousand fold as much as he has
wounded the law, whose servant he is, or the fair fame
of Massachusetts, of which he is a citizen; not so much
as his decision will wound the hearts of an intelligent
posterity, who shall look back upon it as a partisan and
an ignoble act, not to be remembered without a sigh.</p>

<p>If the legal relations of slavery did not sustain the
moral ones, as the root sustains the branches and nourishes
the fruit, those moral relations would seem to demand
all our attention. I know but comparatively
little, and no man living at the north can know but
comparatively little, of the various and ever-repeated
wickednesses of this institution. It has been my lot,
however, to live for about half the time, during the
last four years, in the midst of a milder form of slavery.
And besides this, I was once engaged for about
six weeks in the trial of causes growing directly out
of slavery; and that experience gave me some insight
into its dreadful mysteries. For a moment, the wind
blew the smoke and flame aside, and I looked into its
hell. I saw, then, as I had never seen before, what a
vital and inextinguishable interest every human being
has in this subject;—not the slaves alone, but the
free men; not voters only, but all who can be affected
by votes; not men only, but especially women.</p>

<p>For this reason, I am glad to see so many ladies in<span class="pagenum" id="Page_509">[Pg 509]</span>
this audience. It becomes them to be here. If any
mortal should cultivate an abhorrence of slavery, the
female sex should do it. Whatever any one may hold
to be the social relation between free women and slave
women, yet before God and Christ, and all the holy
angels, they belong to the same sisterhood of the
human race. They are your sisters. And what is the
condition of these your sisters, in regard to everything
that a virtuous and noble woman holds most sacred
and dear?</p>

<p>Ladies, there are now in this land of pretended freedom
and pretended gospel a million and a half of
women who have no practical knowledge of what a
woman’s higher life should be, or what a woman’s
most precious rights are. Since the Declaration of
Independence, the number of slaves in this country
has increased from less than five hundred thousand to
more than three millions; and before the close of this
century, their descendants will increase to more than
thrice three millions. And yet, neither as to the living
nor as to the dead, has there ever been a lawful marriage
among them all. There has never been a man
slave who could say, “This is my wife, heart of
my heart, and life of my life, and no mortal power
shall pluck her from my side.” There has never been
a woman slave who could say, “This is my lawful,
wedded husband, whom I promise to love and cherish,
and to whom I vow inviolable constancy.” “For
this cause,” says Christ, “shall a man leave father and
mother, and shall cleave to his wife, and they twain
shall be one flesh.” But the “twain” of slaves are
never one. And even when any sham ceremony is
observed, to distinguish this holy relation of husband
and wife from the cohabitations of beasts, and he who
officiates comes to those other words of Christ, “What,
therefore, God has joined together, let not man put
asunder,” he stops; for he knows, and they all know,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_510">[Pg 510]</span>
that a few dollars, at any time, will bring bereavement
upon both,—a double bereavement, he a widower and
she a widow, both still surviving. Their life, at
best, is but a life of concubinage;—not even that
concubinage, which, though not founded upon a lawful
contract, has still something like conjugal fidelity
in it, and therefore a semblance of virtue; but a various
and vagrant concubinage, traversing the circle of overseer,
master, master’s guests, and master’s sons. The
fate of the children born to the slave mother you all
know. Those objects upon which all maternal affections
meet and glow as in a focus, are torn from her
bosom, like lambs from the flock when the shambles
are empty.</p>

<p>And as to those females who are young, sprightly,
and handsome:—</p>

<p>Charge me not with indelicacy in touching upon
this theme. <i>Honi soit qui mal y pense.</i> I speak not
to fastidious ears, but to the pure in heart, to whom all
things are pure. I speak of eternal verities, before
whose massive force the heart trembles and bows
itself, as reeds before the tempest. It is the grossest
and most shameless of all indelicacies to patronize and
multiply vice, through pusillanimity in exposing it,—</p>

<p>As to those females, I say, who are young, sprightly,
and handsome, whom God has damned with beauty
of form and beauty of face, because they only attract
the gloating eye of passion, who can describe the loathsomeness
of their life? They are ripened for the New
Orleans, or for some other market, whence southern
harems are supplied; as, under the Mahometan religion,
white Caucasian beauties are sent to the slave marts of
the darker-skinned Turk.</p>

<p>In that company of seventy-six persons who attempted,
in 1848, to escape from the District of Columbia
in the schooner Pearl, and whose officers I assisted
in defending, there were several young and healthy<span class="pagenum" id="Page_511">[Pg 511]</span>
girls who had those peculiar attractions of form, of feature,
and of complexion, which southern connoisseurs
in sensualism so highly prize. Elizabeth Russell was
one of them. She fell immediately into the slave-traders’
fangs, and was doomed for the New Orleans
market. The hearts of those who saw her and foresaw
her fate were touched with pity. They offered
eighteen hundred dollars to redeem her, and some
there were who offered to give, who would not have
had much left after the gift. But the fiend of a slave
trader was inexorable. He knew how he could transmute
her charms into gold through the fires of sin.
He demanded twenty-one hundred dollars, (though for
menial services she would not have been worth more
than four or five,) and would take nothing less. She
was despatched to New Orleans, but when about half
way there, God had mercy upon her and smote her
with death. Perhaps, foreseeing her fate, she practised
what, under such circumstances, we might call the
virtue of suicide. There were two girls named Edmundson
in the same company. When about to be
sent to the same market, an older sister went to the
shambles to plead with the wretch who owned them,
for the love of God, to spare his victims. He bantered
her, telling her what fine dresses and fine furniture
they would have. “Yes,” said she, “that may do
well in this life, but what will become of them in the
next?” They, too, were sent to New Orleans, but
they were afterwards redeemed at an enormous ransom,
and brought back. There was one girl, who, after her
recapture in the Pearl, was sold six times in seven
weeks, in Maryland and Virginia, for her beauty’s sake.
But she proved heroically and sublimely intractable.
Like Rebecca, the Jewess, she would have flung herself
from the loftiest battlement, rather than yield her
person to a villain. Notwithstanding her masters’ pretence
that they had bought her with their money, and<span class="pagenum" id="Page_512">[Pg 512]</span>
owned her soul, yet she had wealth, which, though all
the earth were “one entire and perfect chrysolite,” it
could not buy. It was not difficult, therefore, to purchase
her, and she was redeemed and came to New
York; and I have been informed in the most authentic
manner from the lady of the very respectable family of
which she became an inmate, that, on an examination
of her person, after the healing-time of the journey had
passed, her body was found scarred and waled with
whip marks, which the villains inflicted upon her because
she would not come to their bed.</p>

<p>Now, suppose a sister or daughter of yours, of this
heroic soul and spotless purity, should find herself on
the way to New Orleans;—suppose, by almost superhuman
power and adroitness, she should escape, and
should thread her solitary and darksome path, for hundreds
of miles, towards the north star; should lie down
in caverns, with poisonous reptiles by day, and pursue
her lonely journey by night, finding the beasts of the
forests to be less terrible than man; should swim rivers,
and keep off famine by roots and insects, until at
last, thanks be to God, she sets her mangled and bleeding
feet upon the soil of freedom. Perhaps some echo
of the fame of the Pilgrim mothers has reached her
ears. She has heard of Boston and its noble women
of old, and she hies hither as to a city of refuge,—as
to a sanctuary where virtue has an altar, and where
she can lay down her hunted and weary body, and be
at rest. Fallacious hope! The lecher pursues his
prey, and he is here. He goes to some Glossin lawyer
who sues out a warrant; and to some Jack Ketch who
serves it. The victim is seized at midnight, under
some lying charge, and she is carried before a commissioner,
whose conduct, were he a <i>quasi</i> judge, as he
pretends to be, would be enough to make every hair
of the judicial ermine forever detestable. Here a process
is gone through which she does not understand,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_513">[Pg 513]</span>
and some papers are read of which she never heard,
and then a judgment is pronounced that her “labor”
is “due” to her pursuer, (and such labor!) that she
“owes service” to him, (and such service!) and then
the commissioner delivers her into his arms, and pockets
a fee which common pimps would be ashamed to
work for.</p>

<p>And, my friends, the keenest pang in the grief of all
this is, that there is no fiction or romance about it. A
commissioner who could bring himself down to send a
<i>man</i> to a Georgia cotton-field under this law, the first
time trying, could send a virtuous and spotless woman
into enforced harlotry the second time; and the prince
of darkness only knows what he could not set him to
do afterwards. The clergymen who could defend the
enslavers of Sims because he “owed” the “service”
of one sex, could defend the enslavers of a woman because
she “owed” the “service” of the other sex;—the
clergymen of the rich parishes I mean;—for it
happens, with the constancy of a law of nature, that it
is only the clergymen of the rich parishes who do this.
Do they not know how to serve and reverence their
Lord and Master,—that is, their Landlord and Paymaster!</p>

<p>But, fellow-citizens, as our feelings are stimulated
to the keenest sensibility, in looking at the infinite of
wrong which slavery commits; as we see the millions
and millions of human beings dimly emerging into
view, and crowding down the vista of futurity to blast
our eyes with the vision of their woe, a potent voice
rings in our ears, exclaiming, “<i>Conquer your prejudices</i>,”
“<span class="smcap">Conquer your prejudices</span>.” And this execrable
counsel is uttered in reference to the infinite
crime and disgrace of sending into slavery, without a
trial, those who are free under our laws,—the men to
stripes and death, and the women to the body’s shame
and the soul’s perdition. Fouler, baser, more ungodly<span class="pagenum" id="Page_514">[Pg 514]</span>
counsel was never uttered, since it was said to our first
parents in the garden of Eden, “On the day thou eatest
thereof thou shalt not surely die.”</p>

<p>And what is it that this long-honored eulogist of
liberty, but now its great apostate, blasphemes with the
name of “<i>prejudice</i>”? If there be one sentiment
more deeply rooted in the public heart of Massachusetts
than any other, more intertwined and grown
together with all the fibres of its being, it is the sentiment
of liberty. We have drunk it in with our
mothers’ milk; we have imbibed it from all the lessons
of the school-room and the teachings of the sanctuary;
we have inspired it with the atmosphere we breathe,
and our organs have been attuned to it from our birth,
by the anthems of the mountain’s wind and the ocean’s
roar. It was from the love of liberty that our earlier
fathers plucked themselves up by the roots from that
natal soil into which they had been fastening for centuries.
For this they wandered abroad upon the ocean,
deeming its ingulfing surges to be more tolerable than
a tyrant’s power. For this they transplanted themselves
to this land, at that time more distant and more
formidable to them than any part of the habitable globe
could now be to us. For this they performed the
double task of enduring all privations and dangers, and
at the same time of laying the foundations of all our
free and glorious institutions; and as the sires were
stricken down by toil and death, the sons took up the
work and bore it on, generation after generation.</p>

<p>For this noble sentiment of liberty our later fathers
encountered the perils and deaths of a seven years’
war, and amid poverty and destitution, amid hunger
and cold and nakedness, without any of the protections
and defences of battle which the wealth of their foe
could command, they bared their noble breasts to the
shock of the mailed legions of the British crown. And
when the struggle was ended and the triumph won,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_515">[Pg 515]</span>
they achieved labors of peace not less magnanimous and
wonderful than their labors of war.</p>

<p>They were the pattern men of the world;—not
aggressive, not submissive; not hostile, not servile;
doing right, demanding right; they were the men who
would never wield the oppressor’s rod, and would go
mad at the touch of his heel.</p>

<p>Now, there is not one of all those glorious deeds,
from the embarkation at Delfthaven to the signing of
the peace of 1783, or the inauguration of the federal
government in 1789, which was not begotten by the
love of liberty, or would have been performed without
its creative energy. And yet, the arch-apostate, standing
in the city of Boston, the home of old Samuel
Adams and John Hancock, within a stone’s throw of
the spot where Benjamin Franklin was born, in sight
of Bunker Hill, and with Lexington and Concord, as
it were, just hiding themselves behind the hills for
shame, calls all this a “prejudice,” and commands us to
cast it from us as an unclean thing. Was it not enough
to make the stones in the streets, and every block in
that eternal shaft which marks the spot where Warren
fell, cry out “with most miraculous organ” to rebuke
him?</p>

<p>We have another, and it is a kindred “prejudice.”
We have a “prejudice” of sixty years’ standing in favor
of the principle of the ordinance of 1787. That
ordinance has been cherished in our memories, it has
been taught to our children, and we have displayed it
before the world both as the pledge and the promise of
our devotion to liberty. Five states, now numbering
five millions of men, were the battalions whom that
ordinance wheeled from the ranks of Belial to the
Lord’s side. Hundreds of times have the Whig party
and the Democratic party resolved that the principle
of that ordinance should be maintained inviolate. Mr.
Webster claimed the application of it to the new<span class="pagenum" id="Page_516">[Pg 516]</span>
territories, as his thunder, and swaggered as he rattled it.
Now he calls the great achievement of Thomas Jefferson
and Nathan Dane a “<i>prejudice</i>,” and dishonors
their graves by his scoffs. He abandons the vast regions
of Utah and New Mexico to the slaveholder; he
gives more than fifty thousand square miles of free
territory to Texas; he gives ten millions of dollars in
money, (more than, with all our devotion and self-sacrifice,
we have been able to appropriate to public
education in Massachusetts for the last ten years;)
and worse than this, he gives permission that she may
carve out of her territory a slave state <i>additional</i> to
what had been unconstitutionally contracted for when
she came into the Union.</p>

<p>And for what does he flout us, by stigmatizing all
these sacred convictions and sentiments and instincts
as “<i>prejudices</i>”? Only to feed the famine of his ambition.
He began to see, what every body else has so
long seen, that his vices were bringing upon him the
retribution of premature old age and decrepitude; and
that, unless he could enter the White House the next
term, he must wait, at least until the great Julian period
should bring the world round again. He parleyed
with southern tempters, and fell.</p>

<p>Nor did he outrage our feelings only. He sacrificed
our pecuniary interests, our very means of subsistence.
Massachusetts would be prospering under an improved
system of protection for our domestic industry to-day,
but for Mr. Webster’s apostasy, which stripped us of
all our power and of all our unity, and inflamed the
spirit of southern aggrandizement to demand every
thing and yield nothing. Could the issue be now
formed, and the case tried, whether Daniel Webster’s
course in 1850 did not deprive the working-men of
the country of a tariff for the protection of their labor,
not an intelligent and impartial jury could be found
that would not bring him in guilty. This result<span class="pagenum" id="Page_517">[Pg 517]</span>
every unbiased man at Washington saw, last summer;
while he was cajoling the men of the north with the
delusion that, if they would surrender liberty, they
should have their reward in a tariff. I speak of this
with confidence, because there are hundreds of my
constituents and acquaintances who will bear me witness
that, in personal interviews, and by correspondence,
they were warned, that if they followed Mr.
Webster in his recreancy to principles, he would leave
them without relief in the matter of property.</p>

<p>Fellow-citizens, I will trespass upon your attention
but for a moment longer. I wish to advance one idea
for the consideration of all sober, moral, and religious
men; and when this idea is duly considered, I trust to
its working a revolution in public sentiment. In selecting
men to be our political leaders, we have sometimes
committed the gravest moral error. We have
assumed the falsity of a distinction between a man’s
public and his private life. We have supposed that
the same individual might be a bad man and a good
citizen; might be a patriot and an inebriate, a faithful
officer and a debauchee, at the same time; might serve
his country during “office hours,” and the powers of
darkness the rest of the twenty-four. But I say, as
of old, no man can serve God and mammon.</p>

<p>We have been too prone to judge of men by their
professions and by their connections. We seem to
have forgotten that the tree is to be known by its fruit,
and a man by his life. If we are to take the Pharisee’s
rule, and determine a man’s piety by his creed, and by
the number and length of his prayers, then piety will
be the cheapest thing in the market, and as worthless
as it is cheap.</p>

<p>In choosing teachers to be the guides and exemplars
of our children, we demand high moral worth; and
we would as soon thrust our youth into the centre of<span class="pagenum" id="Page_518">[Pg 518]</span>
pestilence, as amid the contagion of vicious and profligate
men.</p>

<p>In selecting our religious guides, we feel almost justified
in being captiously and morbidly critical; we
hardly admit that we can be strict to a fault; and the
man who fails to carry personal purity and exemplariness
into the pastoral life, is driven from it with
indignation and contempt.</p>

<p>I admit too, rejoicingly, that, in Massachusetts, this
preventive and praiseworthy discipline has been more
extensively applied to political men than in any other
state in the Union. Our highest state offices have
been filled for years, saving very rare exceptions, with
men of distinguished probity and a spotless life. And
why, in this department, should we <i>ever</i> grant dispensations
and absolutions; or, like the old popes, sell
indulgences to sin?</p>

<p>Now, let this doctrine be applied; for I hold it to be
no unwarrantable invasion of private character to apply
these principles to public men. When public men openly
and notoriously practise vice, they make the vice public,
and bring it within public jurisdiction. If it is public
for example, it is public for criticism; and, under such
circumstances, the moral and religious guides of the
community are as solemnly bound “truly to find, and
due presentment make,” of these offences, as the grand
jury is in the case of crimes against the laws of the
land. I say, therefore, let us apply this doctrine.</p>

<p>How long have all good citizens in Massachusetts
labored in the glorious cause of temperance! They
have devoted time, expended talent, lavished money,
incurred obloquy; but, as their reward, they have
plucked the guilty from perdition; rescued the young,
just losing their balance over the precipice of ruin;
saved the widow and the fatherless from unutterable
woe, and driven demons of discord from domestic<span class="pagenum" id="Page_519">[Pg 519]</span>
Edens. Now why, after all our toils and sacrifices to
uphold and carry forward the cause of temperance,
and to make its name as honorable as it is blessed;
why should we demolish all our work by elevating
a man to a high political station, or by upholding him
when in it, who, in the face of the nation and of the
world, will become so drunken that he cannot articulate
his mother tongue? Is this an example you desire
to set before the ingenuous and aspiring youth of the
land; ay, before your own children?</p>

<p>We have had men in the presidential chair not
without faults and blemishes of character; but hitherto
we may proudly say, that we never have had one
there who drowned his reason in his cups. God grant
that we never may. Think of this magnificent ship
of state freighted with twenty-three millions of souls,
and laden to the scuppers with the wealth of the
world’s hopes, with a pilot at the helm—<i>drunk</i>!</p>

<p>We are an industrious and a frugal people. The
aptitude is born with us. A true Massachusetts boy
seems to take to ingenious labor and to labor-saving
contrivances from his birth,—like a duck almost impatient
to be hatched, that it may get into the water.
We prize and honor the home-bred virtues of diligence
and thrift; for they bestow upon us all our comforts,
the means of educating our children, and leave us a
magnificent surplus for godlike charities to be scattered
over the world.</p>

<p>Dr. Franklin has stamped a family likeness upon us
all. His economical wisdom is domesticated among
us. Take a sound and pure specimen of a Massachusetts
farmer or mechanic, and analyze him, and
you will find that, of his whole composition, from six
to ten ounces in the pound is made up of Dr. Franklin.
Now, why should we root out this luxuriant, fruit-bearing
virtue? Why welcome and court and feed
the prodigalities and sensualities of the old world, to<span class="pagenum" id="Page_520">[Pg 520]</span>
corrupt the pristine virtues of the new? Can he be a
republican after the severe simplicity and grandeur of
the old Roman type; can he be an exemplary citizen,
who must have his thirty, forty, or even fifty thousand
dollars a year, to squander upon what I must not call,
“to ears polite,” his vices and passions, but, more genteelly,
“his tastes and feelings,” while millions of
honest laborers thank God if by incessant toil they can
earn their daily bread for their families, and the bread
of knowledge for their children? Can they be good
citizens, or, at least, are they not grievously deluded,
who will give such purses to such a man for being the
advocate and agent of their special interests, while
there are hundreds of suffering men and women, and
more suffering children, at their own doors? Do you
want your children to grow up inflamed by such examples
of excess and wantonness? I know that all
this is defended on the ground that something must be
done for a great man’s family. <i>Ay, that family!</i>
The progeny and costliness of the vices, what Californias
shall be able to support? I know, too, that it
is also said we must have great talents in the public
councils, at whatever price. Well, if this be your
philosophy, don’t do the work by halves, but import
Lucifer at once!</p>

<p>Now, fellow-citizens, you know that all the men
who are guilty of these great derelictions from civil
and social duty are the men who uphold the Fugitive
Slave law.</p>

<p>I might touch upon more holy relations in life;
upon virtues without which there is no home and no
domestic sanctuary; without which there may be
children, but the sacred institution of the family is
gone. But I forbear. I only desire to awaken your
attention to the great duty of extending the domain
of conscience over politics; of holding public men
answerable for those vices which it is a great misnomer<span class="pagenum" id="Page_521">[Pg 521]</span>
to call private when they are committed in the
face of the world. “The pulpit is false to its trust”
if it does not follow and rebuke them, under whatever
robes of official dignity they may hold their revels.</p>

<p>Three great stages of development belong to the
world. First, there was the period of physical development,
when the tallest man was crowned king,
when the strongest muscles enacted the laws, when
brute force was “His Royal Majesty,” and claimed and
received the homage of mankind. That age has
passed; and how contemptible does all its greatness
now appear! Then came the age when the mind
towered above the body, when a nation’s power no
longer consisted in the millions of its men, but in the
treasuries of its knowledge; when the intellect took
up the vastest concentrations of animal strength, which
seemed omnipotent before, lifted them off their fulcrum,
and they became like a feather, in the breath
of its power. That age is the present. The moral
age is yet to be ushered in. In this age, the intellectual
forces shall still retain all their dominion and supremacy
over the physical world, but the moral shall
preside over the intellectual, and move them as God
moves the stars, bringing them out of chaos, and
wheeling them in circuits of unimaginable grandeur,
and for purposes of beneficence yet inconceivable. In
that day, the lawgivers of the land shall be no longer
“compromisers” between duty and mammon, and the
judges shall judge in righteousness. In that day, the
merchant, for the lucre of trade, shall not pay tribute
in human beings, and send his flesh-tax across the free
waters. In that day, the gospel of human brotherhood,
of doing as we would be done by, and of loving our
neighbors as ourselves, shall no longer be doled out to us
by priests of the broad phylactery sort, in homœopathic
doses, reduced to the five hundredth dilution. But in
that glorious day, the men who sit in the Areopagus<span class="pagenum" id="Page_522">[Pg 522]</span>
of the nation, clothed with the ermine of the law,
shall be, as the heathen of old figured the emblem of
Justice, blind in the outward eye; and all they know
of color shall be to give no color to the law. In that
day the successors of St. Paul shall preach what he
preached, when standing “in the midst of Mars Hill,”—a
God of equity, of righteousness, of justice, of
benevolence; the God who made “of one blood all
nations of men,” who, alas! to so many in our day is
“the <span class="smcap">unknown God</span>.”</p>

<p>In that day, when a whole people are aroused to
ponder, with unwonted intensity, upon the great principles
for which Sidney and Vane bled; for which
Hampden smote the tyrant of his day; for which the
heroes of the revolution pledged fortune, life, and
sacred honor; no voice shall strive to seduce them
from their sacred work by its Belial cry, “<span class="smcap">Conquer
your prejudices!</span>”</p>

<p>Fellow-citizens, if you wish to coöperate in bringing
on this glorious era, your first step is to vote for
that noble man who ransomed his own slaves,—<span class="smcap">John

<p><a id="Footnote_21" href="#FNanchor_21" class="label">[21]</a> It is substantially conceded by the supreme court of Massachusetts,
in delivering their opinion on the application of Sims for a writ
of <i>habeas corpus</i>, that the Fugitive Slave law stands upon precedent
alone, and is disowned by principle. Chief Justice Shaw says,—</p>

<p>“At the same time it may be proper to say, that if this argument,
drawn from the constitution of the United States, were now first applied
to the law of 1793, deriving no sanction from contemporaneous
construction, judicial precedent, and the acquiescence of the general
and state governments, the argument from the limitation of judicial
power would be entitled to very grave consideration.”</p>

<p>I submit that the precedents, on this subject, both legislative and
judicial, are substantially divested of all their force, by the fewness
of the cases that have ever arisen under the law, by the general obsoleteness
into which it fell, and, more than all, by that uniform indifference
and neglect, and I may add inhumanity, with which colored
people and the rights of colored people, have been almost universally
regarded in the different states of the Union.</p>

<p>
<span class="smcap">Gentlemen of the Convention</span>;<br>
</p>

<p>I thank you cordially for the honor of being called
to this place; though I could have wished that your
choice had fallen upon some one of the many more
meritorious men whom I see all around me.</p>

<p>Gentlemen, I have come here to-day to add my feeble
voice to the thunder tones of execration against the
Fugitive Slave law, with which every free state in this
Union, and every free community upon the earth, are
now echoing and reëchoing.</p>

<p>I do not propose to occupy your attention long.
Where so many things are to be said, and so many
persons, far better qualified than I am, are present to
say them, I shall consult at once your advantage and
my duty, by being brief.</p>

<p>We have come together with especial reference to
the Fugitive Slave law; but that execrable statute
connects itself so directly with almost every other
prominent measure of the government, and with the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_524">[Pg 524]</span>
leading acts of our public men, during the past year,
that it opens the whole subject of human liberty, and
our duty, as freemen, in regard to human rights. Especially
does it behoove us to inquire, by what means,
by whose instrumentality, the country has been instigated
to this treason against the rights of men, and
when we may expect their machinations will be
brought to an end.</p>

<p>Some of our official dignitaries are giving us law
lectures on the subject of high treason against the government.
I hope they will not object, if we reciprocate
the favor, by giving them a lecture on the higher
treason against God and humanity, of which they are
guilty.</p>

<p>Gentlemen, it is with unspeakable humiliation and
regret that I look back and see where Massachusetts
stood twelve or thirteen months ago, and where so
many of her citizens stand now. Up to that ever-accursed
day, the 7th of March, 1850, there was not a
Massachusetts man, in the councils of the state or nation;—nay,
so far as I know, there was not a single
Massachusetts man any where, of any standing or respectability,
who did not assert and proclaim his hostility
to the extension of slavery; his purpose to maintain
at all times the principle of the ordinance of 1787;
and his “resolute and fixed determination,” (to use
Mr. Webster’s language,) “to make no further concessions
to slavery and the slave power.” The public
men of the state, the press of the state, the legislature
of the state, avowed these sentiments; and the political
conventions of the state rang with these declarations
from side to side.</p>

<p>But on that ever-memorable day a senator of the
United States, from Massachusetts, saw fit to trample
under foot every thing that he had ever said in behalf
of human freedom and against human bondage. He
saw fit to curl his lip and to intonate his voice in scorn<span class="pagenum" id="Page_525">[Pg 525]</span>
of the principle of the ordinance of 1787, and to dishonor
the memory of Nathan Dane, whom, a few
years before, on the same spot, he had eulogized. He
saw fit to contemn what he knew to be the honest
sentiments of Massachusetts. He went far, far out of
his way, to fortify and extend the institution of slavery.
He offered to add new states to its power, and
to take two hundred millions of dollars from the treasury
of the United States, to be expended for its extra-constitutional
security and defence.</p>

<p>I shall not dwell upon the perfidious nature of that
deed, nor upon the obvious motive that prompted it.
I will rather advert to the measures which have since
been taken to corrupt the public sentiment of Massachusetts,
and of the whole north, and to bring over
the people, some to a palliation and others to a full indorsement
of it.</p>

<p>As soon as the stunning effect of that treacherous
blow upon all the moral and religious sensibilities of
the state, and upon its traditional and inwrought love
of liberty, had begun to subside, a systematic effort
was commenced to debauch the patriotism and humanity
of the people, by an appeal to their cupidity. Our
manufacturing and commercial interests were suffering.
A majority of the slave states were the antagonists of
these interests. Political ambition and mercantile cupidity
associated these two facts together, and the flagitious
idea was engendered that by surrendering our
liberty we might have a tariff. The poison of this
idea was first openly and directly infused into the public
mind by Mr. Webster, in his speech at the Revere
House, April 29th, 1850, when he said, “Neither you
nor I shall see the legislation of the country proceed in
the old harmonious way until the discussions in Congress
and out of Congress upon the subject to which you
have alluded, [slavery,] shall be in some way suppressed.
Take this truth home with you, and take it<span class="pagenum" id="Page_526">[Pg 526]</span>
as truth. Until something can be done to allay the
feeling now separating different men and different sections,
there can be <span class="allsmcap">NO USEFUL AND SATISFACTORY</span> legislation
in the two houses of Congress.”</p>

<p>Of this declaration there can be but one interpretation.
It was perfectly understood by those to whom
it was addressed. It says, without enigma or riddle,
surrender the territories to the incursions of the slave
states, pacify the slave power, give up blood-bought
rights for this life, and Savior-bought hopes for another,
and you can have your pay in a cent a yard on
calico, and a cent a pound on iron. And, as a means
of accomplishing this object, it says the discussion of
the slavery question must be “<i>suppressed</i>.”</p>

<p>From that time until the close of the last session
of Congress, in every form in which so intrinsically
wicked an idea could be set forth without shocking
not only all principle, but all decency, this idea was
inculcated upon the public mind of the north, especially
upon the cities. In unofficial speeches and
letters, Mr. Webster urged this seduction more and
more pointedly and earnestly, until, on the 17th of
July, 1850, in the last speech which he ever made in
Congress, he appealed to the senators of the north,
and to the people of the north, in language as explicit
as he could make it, to adopt the compromise measures,
to take even the abhorred Fugitive Slave bill
itself, for the sake of the money to be made out of
them. Throughout that speech he held out the apple
of temptation before their eyes, he jingled the thirty
pieces of silver in their ears, to seduce them into the
surrender of liberty for pelf.</p>

<p>I appeal to the common knowledge of the citizens
of Boston, if, during the last summer, it was not an
expression as familiar to their lips as the salutations
of the day, that they had Mr. Webster’s authority for
saying, that if they would surrender the great questions<span class="pagenum" id="Page_527">[Pg 527]</span>
involved in the compromise, they could have a
tariff.</p>

<p>Now, on this state of facts, I have two observations
to make,—</p>

<p>1st. That a proposition to barter or to jeopard the
liberty of our fellow-beings for any amount of money,
however great, was intrinsically inhuman and wicked.</p>

<p>2d. That every new concession we made to the
south on the subject of slavery, for the sake of getting
protection for our manufactures and other industrial
interests, only impaired and postponed our chance of
getting that protection.</p>

<p>For the correctness of the first of these propositions,
I appeal to every man who has a conscience, or even
any elementary ideas of right or wrong, which are
not smothered by his interests or his passions. And
for the second, I appeal to the case of Texas which
defeated the tariff of ’42, and to the fact that, though
we did consent to all the detestable provisions of the
compromise,—slave territories, slave states, ten millions
of dollars for Texas, Fugitive Slave bill, and all,—yet
we get no tariff, and have now no rational prospect
of one.</p>

<p>That the surrender of all our glorious patrimony of
free principles should help to make some northern
man President, I can readily understand. That is
intelligible. Before the 7th of March speech, it was
announced, from high southern sources, that they
would take the northern man for the next presidential
term who would do the most for slavery; and since
that time, the same declaration has been reiterated.
[See, among others, Mr. Toombs’s speech before the
Georgia Union meeting.] But I state it as a fact
within my own personal knowledge, that there was
not an intelligent man in Congress who was not implicated,
on the one side, in the manufacture of goods,
or, on the other, in the manufacture of presidents,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_528">[Pg 528]</span>
who did not then foresee and predict that every forward
step we took towards the compromise was a
step backwards from protection. And we now have
this stubborn fact to show for the soundness of that
opinion,—the event has ratified it. They have not obtained
the tariff they were promised, though they have
given for it the price of blood.</p>

<p>Now I wish to ask the manufacturers and commercial
men of the north, whether, if they had seen,—as
it was seen by every unbiased man at the seat of
government,—that upholding the compromise would
put down protection, they would have consented to
the compromise? And a further question which I
wish to put to all Massachusetts and all New England
is, if, during the last year, we had had the tariff of
1842 in full operation, and if the current of prosperity
had filled the deepest channels that enterprise and
industry had cut for it, whether then Massachusetts
citizens would have unsaid and retracted all the noble
things they have been saying in favor of liberty for
the last ten years; whether then the Massachusetts
press, or so large a portion of it, would be found
openly advocating doctrines which they have always
heretofore professed to hold in utter detestation and
abhorrence? No man will pretend it. If we had had
the tariff of ’42 last year, the compromise measures
never could have passed, and it would have been
impossible for any presidential aspirant, or all of them
together, to have subdued the northern mind to their
acceptance.</p>

<p>The commercial and manufacturing interests of the
north, then, have been deceived, grossly deceived and
imposed upon. When their real interests were all on
the side of freedom, they have been made to believe
that it would promote those interests to unsay all they
had ever said, and undo all they had ever done adverse
to slavery. Their chance for a tariff lay in standing<span class="pagenum" id="Page_529">[Pg 529]</span>
to their principles like men, and not in abandoning
them like cowards. President-making has been the
agency, and Cotton has been the instrument, of this
deception. It has been said that the Press is the
fourth estate in the realm; but I say Cotton is the
fourth estate, for Cotton subdues the Press. The eyes
and ears and nose and mouth of a portion of our
people have been so filled with cotton, that they have
come to consider cotton not only as their daily bread,
but their bread of life.</p>

<p>Gentlemen, whatever convictions or doubts there
may be on the subject of Animal Magnetism, I am a
firm believer in Cotton Magnetism. The southern
planter seems to possess some wizard art, unknown
to the demonology of former times, by which he impregnates
his bales of cotton with a spirit of inhumanity,
with a contempt for all the dearest, tenderest,
holiest ties that bind man to man and heart to heart;
he fills them with this spirit as an electrician fills a
Leyden jar, and then he sends them here; and if the
man who comes within the circle of their influence is
not himself filled with the strong, counteracting, disinfecting
magnetism of duty and truth, of love to God
and love to man, he is overcome and subdued by the
infernal spell; he is brought into “communication”
with the southern sorcerer, and into subjection to his
will; and then he seems bereft of reason and conscience,
he belies his Pilgrim parentage, talks gibberish
about the dissolution of the Union, kneels, lies
down, eats dirt, and says to his southern master, as Balaam’s
beast said to him, “<i>Am I not thine ass upon
which thou hast ridden ever since I was thine?</i>”</p>

<p>Still worse is it, when this cotton, so diabolically
impregnated, gets beneath the rich velvet seats and
embossed cushions of the pulpit;—unless, indeed, a
double measure of the spirit of the Lord shall descend
upon the preacher and exorcise both him and it, of the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_530">[Pg 530]</span>
evil spirit it contains. When the soul of the clergyman
is struck with this cotton magnetism, he grows
delirious over his Bible, ignores the new dispensation,
seeks out all the pro-slavery parts of the old, discards
Jesus Christ as his example, and the precepts of Jesus
Christ as the law of his ministrations, and proves
himself a pagan, discoursing paganism in a Christian
pulpit.</p>

<p>God grant that this kind of cotton may never stuff
the cushions of our judges! I fear we are not wholly
out of danger of so unspeakable a calamity. Give us
the old English woolsack for them, within whose
magic presence the chains of the slave drop from his
limbs, and he is gloriously transfigured into a man.</p>

<p>Compare the newspapers of our cities now with
what they were only one short twelvemonth ago, and
see what demoralization cotton can work when it gets
into editorial chairs.</p>

<p>As for those slave-catching commissioners who assume
to exercise the functions of judges, to abolish
human liberty, and to find property in the bodies and
souls of men, but are no more a judge than an image
“made after supper of a cheese-paring” is a man,—as
for them, I say, they seem to have this virus the
natural way; and if all moral diagnosis does not fail,
it would be found, on an anatomical dissection of their
hearts, that their right and left auricle and their right
and left ventricle were only four cotton bolls.</p>

<p>But I believe that the reign of Cotton is to be
short-lived. Improvements in the arts give confident
promise that some new textile substance will soon be
discovered which will supersede this slave-made and
slave-making material. Even should this hope fail,
every body sees what an unnatural attitude of power
and strength the cotton-producing states now occupy.
Extending over only a small area of territory, which
you can cover on the map with your hand, they raise<span class="pagenum" id="Page_531">[Pg 531]</span>
a staple which clothes, more or less, a great part of
the world; while there are Brazil, Egypt, India, and
regions of unknown vastness in Africa, to all of which,
or nearly all of which, the plant is indigenous. Either
then by the progress of the arts, or by an extension
of cultivation, the majesty of Cotton will soon be dethroned;
and then, <i>then</i>, how will these men appear,
historically, who are now willing to trample upon
human rights, and to send men, women, and children
into all the horrors of southern bondage for the temporary
profits which cotton can bestow?</p>

<p>I rejoice that this reference to the demoralizing
power of interest gives me an opportunity to bestow
well-deserved honor and praise upon a class of men
who have nobly withstood its temptations. Not every
man engaged in manufactures or in commerce has
yielded to the seductions of this tempter. There are
many noble exceptions. I have in my mind one of my
own constituents largely interested in manufactures,
who told me last summer that half his spindles were
lying idle, and property that should have yielded
income was incurring cost; “but,” said he, “do you
see them <i>all</i> stop, and the mills decay and go down
stream, before you vote for that compromise.” Another
of my constituents told me he was largely interested
in three ships, then at sea; but declared he would see
them all sink to its bottom before he would disgrace
the country by passing the Fugitive Slave bill. These
are but specimens of that noble spirit which was
expressed with such Spartan terseness and vigor by
Bowen &amp; McNamee, of New York, when the foul
panders to southern slavery threatened them with a
loss of custom. Said they, “Our goods, and not our
principles, are in the market.”</p>

<p>O, how these declarations contrast with what a
manufacturer in a neighboring county is reported to
have said,—that if he could work his mills any<span class="pagenum" id="Page_532">[Pg 532]</span>
cheaper with slave labor than with free, he would
employ slaves! And what, also, as I am credibly
informed, another has said,—“The south want slaves
to raise cotton to sell; we want slaves to raise cotton
to manufacture; therefore, we must unite with the
south to uphold slavery.” Now, I believe these things
to have been <i>said</i>; but it is of no consequence
whether they were said or not; we know they have
been <i>acted</i>. Every man who upholds this Fugitive
Slave law <i>acts</i> them, whatever his language may be.</p>

<p>The compromise was forced through Congress partly
by government interference, and partly by the delusive
hope of a tariff. An appeal is now made, in behalf of
the Fugitive Slave law, to the same mercenary motives.
It is said, if opposition be made to this law,
however legal or constitutional such opposition may
be, we shall lose southern custom. Base and infamous
appeal! Such men are made of the stuff of the tories
of the revolution. Even if this appeal were true, it
would be one that no honorable man could hear without
indignation. But it is not true. The south must
have their goods from somewhere, and our industrious
artisans will make them, whoever the go-betweens
may be. Will the south go bare-headed and bare-footed
and unkilted, because they cannot have a law
to catch freemen and slaves promiscuously? But it is
said the south will abandon their slothful habits, become
industrious, and manufacture for themselves. I
wish they would. It would be most fortunate for us.
They would then have the means of buying more
from the north, and paying us better for what they
do buy. Instead of spending only the money which
their slaves earn, they would then have money to
spend earned by the whites, and would become better
customers for those ever new forms of commodities
which our industry and inventive skill, while we keep
our schoolhouses in operation, will always be able to
supply.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_533">[Pg 533]</span></p>

<p>Now, fellow-citizens, I have gone into these considerations
for the purpose of ascertaining and of measuring
the extent and the efficacy of the motives
brought by our opponents to bear against us. You
see they are mercenary, almost exclusively so. As for
that bugbear of a dissolution of the Union, I say, without
fear of contradiction, that no practical man has
ever believed in it for a day. United States stocks at a
hundred and sixteen, on the eve of a dissolution of the
Union! The whole South Carolina, and Mississippi,
and Texas delegations in Congress contending for
every local advantage, for the establishment of new
United States courts, for the increase of salaries, for
appointments at home and abroad, as though the Union
had been just insured for a thousand years! Show
me one intelligent man in the whole country who has
sold his stocks or his farm, or changed his residence, or
altered his course of life in any respect, through fear
that the Union was about to be dissolved. I think
some persons may have left South Carolina, to get rid
of the clamor about dissolving it. Why, what would
the English national debt be worth under any well-founded
apprehension that the British monarchy was
crumbling to pieces? There would not be a pound
of government securities that could not be bought for
a penny. Confidence in the stability of our Union
has not only pervaded this country, but other countries.
The great bankers abroad who deal in our stocks have
never changed their terms one mill in a million of
dollars, through any such idle fear. They are the men
whose barometers presage political storms. With such
facts before us, to say that the Union has been in
danger is as absurd as to say that a whirlwind is
raging when the leaf of the aspen is pendulous, and
cannot be seen to move. If the south wishes to dissolve
the Union, let them do it, and at the end of
thirty years there will be no slave in all their borders.<span class="pagenum" id="Page_534">[Pg 534]</span>
The slaves will have made a new Jamaica or a new
St. Domingo of it, as the masters shall behave themselves.
No, this is nothing but a clumsy trick of the
politicians; and if any one of them could be nominated
for the presidency, we should hear nothing more
from him about any deluge which threatens to submerge
the Union. They profess peculiar love for the
Union. Their clamorous notes bring to mind what
Dr. Franklin remarked of self-righteous people. He
said they always reminded him of scarcity of provisions;—those
who had enough said nothing about it;
it was the destitute who made all the clamor.</p>

<p>I say, then, the only remaining motive with which
our adversaries can work is the loss of southern trade.
This interests but few of our people. The farmers
are not interested in it. The mechanics and artisans
are not. The operatives in our mills are not. All
our substantial, industrious classes are above this temptation,
and would spurn it if they were not above it.
The Fugitive Slave law champions, then, can make
no more converts among them. Let us, then, continue
to oppose this law in all constitutional modes. Let us
explain its religious and moral bearings to the Christian.
Let us tell the patriot of the disgrace it brings upon
our country. Let us show to the working-man that
those who are ready to make slaves of his fellow-beings
for lucre will be equally ready to make a slave of him
whenever interest shall supply the temptation.</p>

<p>Fellow-citizens, it has been asked why we are assembled
here to-day, and not in the Hall consecrated to
liberty. It is because the doors of that hall have been
closed to Liberty knocking for admission. But there is
a melancholy propriety in this. When the court house
is in chains, Faneuil Hall may well be dumb. Those
chains which girt the courts of justice are but typical
of the chains which tyrannous men are striving to put
upon our lips. This is not the first temple that has<span class="pagenum" id="Page_535">[Pg 535]</span>
been unrighteously invaded and taken possession of by
money changers and those who sold doves,—doves!
<i>doves</i>!! No, not doves,—but men, women, and
children. But I trust the time is not far distant when
a better spirit shall enter their doors, and shall scourge
out their invaders with cords, smaller or larger, as the
exigencies of the case may require.</p>

<span class="smcap">Gentlemen of the Convention</span>;<br>
</p>

<p>Accept my thanks. It would be an honor at any
time to stand in this position before a body of men so
large in their number and so influential by their respectability.
But, gentlemen, at this hour of trial, at
this time of peril to great principles, when the lights
upon earth seem to be going out around us, and we
must look for guidance to the lights above,—at this
hour, I say, of trial and of peril, it is an especial
honor to be called to a post of duty. The position
of the friends of freedom at the present time reminds
me of a beautiful sentiment expressed by one of the
noblest of the old Roman philosophers, who said that
those who were called to fill stations of danger and
self-sacrifice should thank God for the honor of being
deemed worthy of such a trust.<a id="FNanchor_25" href="#Footnote_25" class="fnanchor">[25]</a></p>

<p>Gentlemen, it was not until this morning, and
since sunrise, that I was waited upon by a delegation
from your state committee, requesting my presence on
this occasion. They knew, and you all know, how
strongly my heart throbs, even at the mention of the
great principles for which you contend. They knew,
as you all know, how happy I should be if I could do
any thing to deepen or to diffuse a feeling of devotion
to human freedom.</p>
<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_537">[Pg 537]</span></p>
<p>But, gentlemen, there were certain circumstances
connected with my position which seemed to make
it necessary for me to say to your delegation, that, if I
should appear here to-day, it should be with an entire
privilege to speak out my mind fully on any political
subject, and to say in what relation I stand to the present
condition of public affairs, both state and national.</p>

<p>I say, then, gentlemen, that I stand where I have
always stood, holding the principles of human freedom
first and foremost in my regards, and, after these, our
pecuniary, or merely worldly interests; holding, according
to the order in which they are mentioned in
the constitution of the United States, “life and liberty”
to be before “property.” I stand where I stood
in 1848, when I was first elected to Congress; and
where my recorded votes and speeches show me to
have stood through all the struggles of 1849 and ’50.
I stand on the same principles yet. If other men
have seen fit to go off to the right hand or to the left,
I remain where I was. And if any individual of any
party,—Whig, Democrat, or by whatever other appellation
he may be known,—shall ever return from his
wanderings to the good old homestead of Massachusetts
principles,—Free Soil, Free Speech, and Free Men,—there,
in that immortal birthplace of human liberty,
he will find me, early in the morning and late at night,
hard at work, to maintain the honor of the Pilgrims
and the principles of our revolutionary sires.</p>

<p>Gentlemen, the perusal of the address and resolutions
put forth by the Whig State Convention at Springfield,
last week, brought me here. It seems to me that
no true lover of human freedom can read that address
and those resolutions intelligently, and understand their
full scope and bearing, without being struck down by
conviction, as suddenly as was St. Paul,—though the
light and the voice come from an opposite quarter.
Whatever the design of those papers may have been,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_538">[Pg 538]</span>
their whole argument and office are to wheel the Whig
party into line, to fight the battles of slavery.</p>

<p>Under these circumstances, I do not ask with a
certain distinguished individual, on the prospective
breaking up of parties, “Where am I to <i>go</i>?” I
believe I do but echo the sentiments of thousands of
as good and true Whigs as can be found in this commonwealth,
(and there are none better any where,)
when I say that, let others go where they will, here,
<i>here</i>, on the old Whig platform of opposition to the
extension of slavery, either into New Mexico <i>or into
New England</i>; of freedom for the District of Columbia;
and in favor of the old guaranties of <i>habeas corpus</i>
and trial by jury,—<i>here I remain</i>.</p>

<p>Gentlemen, the Free Soil party, as the name imports,
is the party of freedom. The cardinal principle
of their <i>creed</i> is, that “all men are created free and
equal,” and that they have an inalienable right to
“life, liberty, property, and the pursuit of happiness.”
Their <i>faith</i> consists in the assurance that, in the good
providence of God, the day will yet come when the
blessedness of their creed will be realized among men;
and by their <i>works</i> they seek to hasten the advent of
that glorious day.</p>

<p>A party of Freedom has existed in all ages of the
world, but a mightier party of oppression has been
arrayed against it. And though the lovers of human
liberty have consisted of the greatest and best men
who have ever lived, yet they have been overborne
by violence, crushed and trampled upon by power,
buried in dungeons, gibbeted on scaffolds, burnt at
the stake! God, like the householder who sent servants
to his vineyard from a far country, has, from
age to age, sent great and mighty souls into the world
to redeem it from oppression; but the oppressor has
seized and mutilated and martyred them, with every
form of ignominy towards the messengers themselves,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_539">[Pg 539]</span>
and of impiety towards the Lord who sent them. The
possessors of power and wealth seek to perpetuate
these advantages in their families, their clan, or their
caste; and over almost all the earth they have established
dynasties for governments, landed or moneyed
feudalisms for lords, and entails for individual families.</p>

<p>That we may see how fearful a thing this spirit of
oppression is, not only for its cruelties, but for the
tenacity of its malignant life, let it be remembered
that the world had existed almost six thousand years
before the principles of human liberty, civil and ecclesiastical,
were clearly and fully set forth even on
paper. This was first done by Mr. Jefferson, in 1776,
in the Declaration of American Independence; and
every body knows how intensely the same partisans
who are now summoning their forces against the party
of Freedom have hated him for his glorious efforts in
favor of the freedom of man; how they pursued him
with maledictions to his grave, and still break through
the sanctity of the tomb to blacken his memory.</p>

<p>The immortal principles of the Declaration of Independence
were partially embodied in the constitution
of the United States. But, as the preëxisting metaphysics
and mythology of the heathen nations mingled
with the pure spirit of Christianity, and corrupted
it, so the preëxisting laws and usages of oppression
deformed to some extent the doctrines of the Declaration
of Independence, and stamped some hideous features
upon the otherwise fair face of the federal constitution.
But such a preponderance of good did that
instrument contain, that it was adopted by all the
states. It was adopted, however, with the universal
understanding that the healing influence of time would
purge away the virus of the disease; and with no
apprehension of the now undeniable fact, that the
disease would be allowed to spread, like a gangrene,
over the healthy parts. Had our fathers foreseen that<span class="pagenum" id="Page_540">[Pg 540]</span>
the pro-slavery clauses in the constitution would prove
a curse to whole classes and races of men entitled to
protection under it, that they would be a shame to its
administrators, and an opprobrium, throughout the civilized
world, to the name of Republic,—it would be
impious towards their memories to say they would
ever have ratified it. But instead of the sounder
parts diffusing healthful influences, and gradually eradicating
the disease, the diseased parts have shot their
infection through all the veins and organs of the body
politic, until, from the heart to the extremities, there
is not now to be found an uncontaminated spot.</p>

<p>Or to leave metaphor for literal speech: The constitution
of the United States gave the most comprehensive
and fundamental guaranties in favor of freedom,
with here and there only an exception in behalf of
slavery. It allowed “persons” who were held to
service or labor and who should escape into other
states to be retaken, but it also secured the trial by
jury to every “person” who should claim it on any
question of life or liberty, and on all questions of
property even down to the paltry sum of twenty dollars.
Yet there is not now, in the United States, a
single spot, from ocean to ocean, where a free man is
free from danger of being kidnapped and carried into
horrible bondage for himself and his posterity forever;
or,—what is as keenly torturing to every mind penetrated
by the spirit and amenable to the precepts of
the gospel,—of being called upon, under penalty of
fines and fetters, to surrender his soul to this accursed
work.</p>

<p>Now, as a true disciple of Christ ought to feel if he
saw the imbruting dogmas and Moloch rites of heathenism
returning to invade Christendom and to extinguish
the lights of the gospel, so should every lover of
liberty feel when he sees the fell spirit of slavery regaining
its lost empire over the institutions of freedom.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_541">[Pg 541]</span></p>

<p>The analogy between the present condition of this
country and that of Europe is too striking not to attract
attention. In 1848, there was a great uprising
of the friends of liberty in both hemispheres. Thousands
and tens of thousands sought to redress the
wrongs of humanity,—by the cartridge box there, and
by the ballot box here. The phalanx of tyranny and of
mammon was unprepared for so sudden an onset, and
for a moment their ranks were broken by the violence
of the shock. But despotism and wealth have almost
inconceivable advantages in a contest with the honest
and toiling millions. In Europe, they have the military
force,—a soulless machine, always ready to be
turned against the people who are made to maintain it.
They have also the whole ecclesiastical power, which
leans upon the government for support, and fights
with spiritual weapons for the masters whose plunder
it shares.</p>

<p>In this country, owing to our different institutions,
the means of quelling the spirit of liberty have
been different. The administration have an immense
amount of patronage at their disposal. They give
contracts to the amount of millions, and select the
contractors. Directly, or indirectly, they appoint some
thirty thousand office-holders; and, by a lamentable
reduplication of the powers of evil, they control twice
or four times that number who are aspirants for office.
Their influence bought over the slave power, by surrendering
all our new territories to the invasion of
slavery, and by giving fifty thousand square miles of
free New Mexican territory to be turned into Texan
slave territory, thus adding to the already enormous
size of that slave-begotten state. Ten millions of dollars
of almost worthless Texan stock were raised to par
value by the signature of Millard Fillmore. During
the whole pendency of the compromise measures,
agents and brokers, reputed to be interested in this<span class="pagenum" id="Page_542">[Pg 542]</span>
stock, hovered about the purlieus of the national Capitol.
The stock was transferred from hand to hand,
without record and without daylight, so that, besides
the accomplices, Heaven and Satan only know into
whose possession it came. And, as though the means
of patronage and seducement on so magnificent a scale
were not sufficient, a private purse, almost up to the
figure of fifty thousand dollars, was presented to the
“foremost man of all this world” in his apostasy to
the principles of human liberty. These, fellow-citizens,
were among the agencies and seductions which
caused the discomfiture of the friends of freedom in the
national contest of 1850. The tyrants of Europe had
no vacant lands, or Texas stocks, wherewith to put
down humanity, and so they used gunpowder and bayonets.
Our slave power and its northern allies, being
debarred by the principles of our government from
bullets and bayonets, accomplished their work by
the Judas articles of scrip and “dotation.” To
carry out these purposes, the generals Haynau and
Radetsky were found there; the senators, Webster
and Cass, here.</p>

<p>The origin and the present necessity of the Free Soil
party may be briefly stated. Some years previous to
the annexation of Texas, an apprehension existed that
that great breach of the constitution and outrage upon
northern principles and feelings were meditated. Mr.
John Quincy Adams sounded the alarm; but men
were so engrossed by their business, and by their
paltry local and temporary political strifes, that even
his voice, potent and prophetic as it was, passed by
unheeded. Some respect, however, was due, at least
from policy if not from principle, to the many humble
but earnest opponents of so flagrant a wrong. Before
the consummation of that iniquity, the Massachusetts
legislature passed strong resolutions against it. The
question was taken by yeas and nays, and all the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_543">[Pg 543]</span>
Whigs and almost all the Democrats in the general
court recorded their names on the side of the constitution
and liberty. But the slave power then had possession
of all the departments of the national government,
and under the auspices of a slaveholding President,
a breach was made in the walls of the constitution
wide enough to let in a foreign government, with all
its burden of slavery on its back. Yet, notwithstanding
this perfidy to all the principles of a true democracy,
such was the external pressure brought to bear upon
the members of the Democratic party, that but few of
them abandoned its ranks. They “<i>acquiesced</i>,” as
the modern phrase is, when any thing specially iniquitous
is to be sanctioned. They were told, as the
Whigs are now told in regard to the compromise and
the Fugitive Slave law, that the act was <i>done and
irrevocable</i>. The merchants were told, as the Whig
merchants now are, that the crime of extending slavery
would at least be attended by increased profits of trade.
The manufacturers were told, as the Whig manufacturers
now are, that if the number of slaves were increased
at the south, it must create an increased demand
for whips and negro cloths. And the mere
blind political partisans were told, as the same class of
Whigs are now, that if God designed to stop the
heaven-defying enormity of spreading slavery over this
continent, he must do it in some way consistent with
the integrity of the Democratic party. Precisely the
arguments which were then used to seduce and corrupt
the Democratic party into “<i>acquiescence</i>” are used by
leading Whigs and Whig presses now for the same
unhallowed purpose. They are alike, except that in
the one case there was the crime of originality, and in
the other, the meanness of plagiarism.</p>

<p>But from the fatal day of the annexation of Texas,
thousands and thousands of honest and intelligent
Democrats, though still remaining true to what they<span class="pagenum" id="Page_544">[Pg 544]</span>
believed to be the principles of the party, became alienated
from its leaders. From that day, the claims of
the party lay lightly, but the sins of the party heavily,
upon their souls; and some there were who, like Daniel
of old, went into their chambers three times every day,
and, throwing open the windows which looked towards
the Jerusalem of liberty, prayed aloud to the true God,
although within hearing of the wild beasts which had
been prepared to devour them.</p>

<p>The Whig party at the north, and particularly in
Massachusetts, flourished under the reäction of the
Texas fraud. Some of its leaders, it is true, shouted a
welcome to Texas, though yet afar off; and, even while
she stood outside of the Union, they threw their arms
around her blood-besmeared form, hideous as Milton’s
picture of Sin, with all her hell-hound progeny of future
slave states howling in her womb, and gave her a fraternal
embrace; and when the time came, they were
also ready to vote men and money,—human blood
and human souls,—for the robber atrocities of the
Mexican war, which a majority of the House of Representatives
in Congress, on motion of Mr. Ashmun,
of Massachusetts, declared to be “unnecessarily and
unconstitutionally commenced.” My friends, in your
observations of men, you will find there are some
moral nonentities,—political availabilities though they
may be,—who can listen most sanctimoniously to the
Saint Stephens, when they prophesy, and then hold
the clothes of the Lynchers who stone them to death.</p>

<p>During all this period, however, the managers and
the presses of the Whig party discoursed and printed
very edifying anti-slavery homilies. As the harvest
months came on, an anti-slavery zeal became an
epidemic among them; and sporadic cases happened
at other times, depending upon the days and places
appointed by the governor and council for special elections.
Every body remembers how the Boston <i>Atlas</i><span class="pagenum" id="Page_545">[Pg 545]</span>
used to stir up the pure minds of the Democratic party
by way of remembrance, by publishing,—periodically,
as they say, and sometimes oftener,—the names of
those Democratic senators or representatives in our
general court who had voted for freedom and against
Texas, in order to show their flagrant inconsistency
in still adhering to a party that had been false to liberty.
That paper has done some good service to our cause,
especially in holding up for a long time the Fugitive
Slave act to reprobation, while the other Whig presses
in the city were daily striving to hide its atrocities from
public view, and to defend what they could not hide.
I trust the reluctant and struggling editors of that paper
are not to be overcome by the mammon of slavery,
whatever disguises it may assume or compulsion it may
use. I trust the slave power will never be able to use
towards them the language which hell’s portress addressed
to Satan:—</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">
  <div class="stanza">
    <div class="verse indent0">“At first they called me <i>Sin</i>, and for a sign</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Portentous held me; but, familiar grown,</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">I pleased, and with attractive graces won</div>
    <div class="verse indent0"><i>The most averse; thee chiefly</i>.”</div>
  </div>
</div>
</div>

<p>Those prosperous days of the Massachusetts Whigs
continued until 1848. They thrived in basket and in
store, until, like Jeshurun, they waxed fat, and, at
least in the fourth and fifth congressional districts, they
performed some very hard kicking. Then came the
nomination of General Taylor. General Taylor was a
Louisiana slaveholder. He had been the hero of the
Florida war,—as great an outrage against a race as
ever Rome or Russia committed. He had been a
prominent, and, as many believed, a willing instrument
in spilling the innocent blood of a sister republic.
Even should the executive divest him of military command,
or he should grow too old for service, it was
universally known that there was a full black battalion<span class="pagenum" id="Page_546">[Pg 546]</span>
on his own plantation which he would always command.
The south demanded his nomination absolutely.
They would hear no terms, and would offer
no terms. In the northern canvass it was strongly asserted
that he had written a letter, saying in so many
words that he would not veto the Wilmot proviso; but
that letter was so warily kept in a certain unmentionable
part of a Whig merchant’s wardrobe, that neither
Mesmerizers nor spiritual rappers could read it aloud to
the people.</p>

<p>Hence all omens foreboded evil. Those which we
looked for on the earth augured ill to our earthly interests;
and those which we looked for above were in the
wrong quarter of the heavens. The character of many
of General Taylor’s friends brought distrust upon himself.
He owed his election far more to the repulsion
which good men felt towards his opponent, [General
Cass,] than to any attraction they had towards him.</p>

<p>It was an occasion that tried the sagacity and the
discretion of honest men, and I have always felt great
charity both for his advocates and his opponents;—each
being able to make out so plausible a case. The
course which the Connecticut clergyman took on that
occasion always commended itself to me. He voted
the Taylor electoral ticket, but indorsed a prayer on
the back of his ballot, saying that he was painfully
uncertain as to the course of duty, and imploring
that his vote might be sanctified for the good of the
country.</p>

<p>But I am happy to avail myself of this, and of all
opportunities, to do justice to the name of General
Taylor. He turned out a very different man from
what his friends or his foes supposed him to be. I believe
he desired freedom for all the territories; and,
could he have been permitted to carry out his own
plans, he would have secured not only the freedom of
the territories, but would also have consummated all<span class="pagenum" id="Page_547">[Pg 547]</span>
the great national measures of the party that brought
him into power. Mr. Clay threw the first stumbling-block
in his way, by his compromise scheme. This,
alone, might have been surmounted. But Mr. Webster’s
apostasy, on the seventh of March, turned the
tide of battle. It broke up General Taylor’s phalanx,
both north and south. It roused the drooping and
just yielding spirits of the slave power to frantic exertion.
An enemy on the field General Taylor was always
ready to meet; but he was not prepared for
treachery in his own camp. Still, he maintained his
ground resolutely, until struck down by the power that
conquers the conquerors. There are many who believe
it was Mr. Webster’s perfidy, with the nameless
labors and anxieties that came in its train, which
caused General Taylor’s death. It remains to be seen
whether the political Macbeth shall succeed to the
Banquo he spirited away, though all the “weird”
brethren of the slave mart and of the “Union and
Safety Committees” still tempt him onward by their
incantations.</p>

<p>But it was under the circumstances of General Taylor’s
nomination, and not of his death, that a portion
of the Free Soilers parted company with the Whigs;
as another portion did with the Democrats, because of
General Cass’s avowed subserviency to the south,—and
the conduct of all men is to be judged by the circumstances
contemporary with their acts, and not subsequent
to them.</p>

<p>If, however, there are those who judge of motives
by results, this certainly can be said in vindication of
the Free Soil party, that the now acting President of the
United States, who came in on General Taylor’s ticket,
and is now completing his presidential term, has done
more for slavery than the Free Soil party ever predicted
or feared would or could be done by the candidates
whom they opposed. Even now, when the third<span class="pagenum" id="Page_548">[Pg 548]</span>
year of the presidential term is but half spent, the
Whig administration, aided by many leaders in the
Whig party, is carrying out, with a relentless hand, and
a more relentless heart, worse pro-slavery measures
than the Free Soil party ever charged upon them
during the canvass, or ever believed or conceived they
could commit.</p>

<p>Such was the position of affairs in Massachusetts in
1848, when, almost for the first time within the memory
of man, the Whigs failed, at the polls, to elect
electors of President and Vice President.</p>

<p>Let us dwell for a moment on that crisis. It was
during the canvass of 1848 that the Whigs became so
amorous towards the rank and file of the Free Soil
party. No knight-errant ever protested more fidelity,
or vowed to do more valorous deeds in his mistress’
cause. Than some of them, no dove ever cooed with
a sweeter gurgle. Than others, no stag ever offended
with a ranker breath. They wooed them by daylight,
by moonlight, and by torchlight. They swore belief
not only in all the Free Soil scriptures, but in the traditions
of its rabbins. The Ordinance of ’87 they
loved; the Wilmot proviso they loved better; and
would the coy damsel of Free Soilism but consent to
the affiance, the abolition of slavery in the District of
Columbia should gladden the espousals. Every Whig
rally, from ward and school district meetings to monster
mass meetings, resounded with Mr. Webster’s <i>slogan</i>,
or war-cry, “No more slave states! No more slave representation
in the Congress of the United States!”
The Boston Daily <i>Advertiser</i>, the <i>Courier</i>, and the
<i>Journal</i>, which are now south of South Carolina, in
the impiety of the grounds on which they defend the
wrongs and the aggressions of slavery, and shout on
slave hunts over Pilgrim burial grounds,—all gave
back the cry, with three times three, “No more slave
states! No more slave representation in the Congress<span class="pagenum" id="Page_549">[Pg 549]</span>
of the United States!” At all their conventions, the
Whigs “resolved and re-resolved,” and—but I hope we
may not be compelled to finish the line. You were
told there was no more need of a Free Soil party in
Massachusetts than of two suns in the heavens. The
Whigs were the true Free Soilers; they held Free
Soilism as a hereditament, or as an heir-loom long
possessed by the ancient family of the Whigs. Even
Mr. Webster, who had very much withdrawn from
public gaze after the Philadelphia convention, and who,
like Achilles, sat “sulking in his tent” and musing
over the lost Briseis of a nomination, was at last
tempted, by a succession of brilliant retaining fees, to
come forth and reason with these recusant and contumacious
Free Soilers face to face. And what did he
say? Addressing himself distinctively to Free Soilers,
he said, “If, my friends, the term ‘Free Soil’ party,
or ‘Free Soil’ men, is meant to designate one who has
been fixed, unalterable, to-day, yesterday, and for some
time past, in opposition to slavery extension, then I
may claim to be, and may hold myself, as good a Free
Soil man as any member of that Buffalo convention.
I pray to know where is their soil freer than that on
which I have stood? I pray to know what words
they can use, or can dictate to me, freer than those
which have dwelt upon my lips. I pray to know with
what feelings they can inspire my breast <i>more resolute
and firm in resisting slavery</i> <span class="allsmcap">EXTENSION OR ENCROACHMENT</span>
than have inhabited my bosom since the first
time I opened my mouth in public life.”</p>

<p>These, gentlemen, were his words, spoken at Marshfield,
on the first day of September, 1848. If he
were here to-day to address you, could he speak any
<i>words</i> more grateful to your ears? If only truth and
a heart were in that language, could he speak any thing
better?</p>

<p>It was by such false pretences as these that thousands,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_550">[Pg 550]</span>
and I doubt not tens of thousands, of men
wholly penetrated and imbued with Free Soil principles,
were kept in the Whig ranks. I was one of them.
I had faith in men; and I have it still,—with important
exceptions however. The needle points to
the pole; but if you bring a huge black mass of pig
iron and place by its side, it trembles, yet deviates,
like a man struggling to be virtuous before overwhelming
temptations. Remove the disturbing force, and it
returns to its fidelity. So, when the next presidential
election is over, I believe the great body of the rank and
file of the Whig party in Massachusetts will return to
their duty; for I venture to say, that if the Whigs of
Massachusetts, in November, 1848, could have foreseen
the present position of their party, and the demoralization
which its leaders have been able to work in it,
not one third of them, no, not one quarter of them,
could have been induced to vote the ticket that elected
Mr. Fillmore, brought in the present cabinet, and
brought on the present disastrous policy.</p>

<p>But, gentlemen, I am occupying too much of your
time. I will add but a few more words. I said the
address and resolutions of the Whig State Convention,
held at Springfield, last week, brought me here. I have
read them with profound sorrow. It was the first Whig
convention that ever met in Massachusetts that did
not at least put forth some noble doctrines in favor of
freedom, whether they meant to stand by them or not.
Yes, even the convention of 1850,—only one year
ago,—passed the following:—</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>“<i>Resolved</i>, That Massachusetts avows her unalterable determination
to maintain all the principles and purposes she has
in times past affirmed and reäffirmed, in relation to the extension
of slavery.”</p>
</div>

<p>And yet the late convention, the first one that has
met since the resolution which I have just read was<span class="pagenum" id="Page_551">[Pg 551]</span>
adopted, has endorsed the present administration, which
has done more to corrupt and deaden public sentiment
at the north, as to the wrongs of slavery to the enslaved,
and its injury to the free, and to aggrandize the
pro-slavery south, and foster and encourage, ay, and
<i>reward</i> its aggressions;—has done more, I say, than
any other administration that ever existed under this
government. History will bear me out in this statement.
Yet, at this crisis in human affairs, the one
idea, the master purpose of the address and resolutions
of that convention, seems to have been, to disparage
and depreciate the great, eternal principles of freedom,
and to bring odium and contempt upon the only party
now organized for their support.</p>

<p>Gentlemen, the Whig leaders, in this respect, and in
regard to this most important and paramount attribute
of the Whig party, have lurched and lurched round,
until they have got into the very trough of the pro-slavery
sea. Its members, I admit, are free to follow
them to their ruin, if they will; but free, too, I thank
God, to go on in their old course, steering for the haven
of honor and liberty. I give the great majority even
of the Whig leaders the credit of having yielded to
this pressure reluctantly, and under what they deemed
a sort of political duress; for, gentlemen, a new and
most alarming fact in the history of the Whig party of
this country has been developed within the last two
years. It is this: formerly, and universally, the Whig
administration was supposed to be chosen to carry out
the views of the Whig party; but the present administration,
having abandoned the grounds on which it
obtained power, and having, for its own purposes,
taken new grounds, now demands of the Whig party
to carry out,—not the old policy of the Whigs, but
the new policy of the administration.</p>

<p>Fellow-citizens, could Mr. Fillmore by any possibility
have been elected, in 1848; could he have<span class="pagenum" id="Page_552">[Pg 552]</span>
got so many as ten thousand votes among all the
Whigs of the Northern States, had his present attitude
on the subject of slavery been foreseen?</p>

<p>Was there ever an hour when Mr. Webster could
have obtained one tenth part,—one fiftieth part,—of
the votes of the Massachusetts legislature for the office
of senator, had the curtain of the future been lifted
up, and his present position been revealed? You
know there never was. But, during the year 1850,
without any initial change, or symptom of a change, on
the part of northern Whigs, the administration, prompted
by its own purposes, or yielding from its own weakness,
faced square about; and ever since that time it
has been striving, by all the lures of patronage and
the terrors of denunciation, to force the Whigs of the
north on to a kind of political turn-table, like those
railroad turn-tables you see at a car-house, so that the
whole party, too, should be faced square about, made
to retrace their course, by going backward among the
same people who had seen them go forward, shouting
down all they had shouted up, and forswearing all the
glorious doctrines of liberty to which the whole world
had heard them swear. Gentlemen, if, in this stress
of circumstances, any body asks me, “Where shall I
go?” my reply is, Don’t get on to that political turn-table
which the administration has prepared for the
Whig party, and not the Whig party for the administration;
for it will carry your country to ruin, and
yourself to dishonor.</p>

<p>During the canvass last autumn for a member of
Congress for the eighth district, when, as you all know,
there were such “godlike” exertions made against my
election, I was asked, as a test question, by numbers
of most respectable members of the Whig party,
what I thought of the Free Soil party, and their proposed
coalition at that time. I replied to them in the
following words, and my answer is now on record in<span class="pagenum" id="Page_553">[Pg 553]</span>
the hands of my constituents: “I say, as I have
often said, that, if the Whigs will live up to their professions
a hundred times made, I see no reason or
warrant for separate organizations or coalitions. But
if the great body of the Whigs mean to belie all their
professions, and to persecute and punish all who remain
faithful to the lessons which the Whig party itself has
been teaching so strenuously for so many years, then
what true Whig can blame any man for attempting to
carry out what the Whigs themselves have promised to
do, but have abandoned?”</p>

<p>But the Massachusetts Whig State Convention at that
time passed the most pointed and emphatic resolution,
affirming anew what they avowed themselves to have
affirmed and reäffirmed so often before, on the subject
of slavery. I reposed trust in their honesty; I believed
in their veracity; and, as a consequence of my
faith, I voted the entire Whig state ticket. Having
read their last address and resolutions, I must now say,
that if they desire any more votes of mine, they must
revive my faith by some new evidence of their good
works.</p>

<p>Let me advert to a few of the more salient points in
that address. It labors to sustain a charge of coalition
against the Free Soil party. Well, before I either
approve or condemn a “coalition,” I must know by
whom, and for what purpose, it was formed. A coalition,
I suppose, like other acts, must be right or wrong
according to the motive that prompts it.</p>

<p>But it is said the Free Soil party formed an alliance
with those who, on some important points, had no
sympathy with it. And where is this said? Why,
in a land where our revolutionary fathers, fighting for
freedom and for a republic, formed an alliance or coalition
with monarchical and despotic France, and with
monarchical and despotic Spain. What were the
points of resemblance or unison between the American<span class="pagenum" id="Page_554">[Pg 554]</span>
Confederation on the one side, and France or Spain
on the other? In government, in policy, in manners,
in education, in religion, nothing could have been more
different. In what did they agree? In hostility to
Great Britain alone; but not in a single one of the reasons
for that hostility, nor in but one of the objects to
be accomplished by it,—the humiliation of a haughty
and overbearing power.</p>

<p>At the same time, Great Britain formed coalitions
with the North American savages, to extinguish the
rising dawn of freedom. And in this they have been
too faithfully imitated by the old hunkers of both parties;—<i>imitated</i>,
I say, not only in the object and
spirit of the coalition, but in the weapons with which
the warfare is waged. Yes, fellow-citizens; for there
is an attempt, and that attempt is to be followed up,
to overwhelm the Free Soil party by obloquy and denunciation.
There is to be a cry of “bargain and
corruption” to put down the Free Soil party, just as
the administration of Mr. John Quincy Adams was put
down by the same cry. Who now believes any thing
about the charge of “bargain and corruption” against
Mr. Adams,—except that it was a villanous charge?
I believe the same charge against the Free Soil party
will have come, twenty years hence, to the same result,—that
of conferring honor upon its object, and
infamy upon its authors.</p>

<p>But it is said the Free Soil party have seized the
offices and emoluments of the state. I was absent
last January at the time of the organization of the
state government; but I have heard that those who
were distinctively called Free Soilers received only
the office of secretary of state, and president of the
senate, and two or three out of the nine councillors;—all
of them nearly or quite without patronage. I suppose
all their emoluments combined would not equal
what is received by the Boston postmaster, or the collector<span class="pagenum" id="Page_555">[Pg 555]</span>
of the Boston port. Vast “ways and means”
these for the corruption of the people! The whole of
them would not suffice a cabinet officer for a <i>bonne
bouche</i> or a tidbit.</p>

<p>And now I suggest a further point. Was there
a single Free Soiler who received an office last winter,
on what is called the <i>division of the spoils</i>, which the
people, when they voted for him at the polls, did not
desire and mean that he should receive?</p>

<p>Now, I need not say that when men conspire or
coalesce for a selfish purpose, whether that purpose be
office, or emolument, or the profits of trade, or the
increase of dividends, and especially if they sacrifice
great principles of public utility, or morality, or religion,
for the selfish end, I condemn the deed with
my whole heart. So when representatives, or agents
of any kind, are elected or appointed for special purposes,
and by votes or influences without which they
could not have obtained their posts, and then, for their
own ambitious or mercenary objects, <i>they</i> coalesce to
defeat the will of their constituents, any severity of
language, in holding up their conduct to reprobation,
may be used with my full consent. Precisely of this
nature was the coalition between Mr. Webster and
General Cass, to carry through the compromise measures
and the Fugitive Slave bill. Both were agents,
both betrayed and violated the will of their principals.
Could Mr. Eliot, of Boston, have been elected to Congress,
had he avowed his intention to vote for the Fugitive
Slave bill? Every body knows he could not.
Yet he coalesced with the secessionists, Messrs. Clingman
and Venable, of North Carolina, and with the
whole South Carolina disunion delegation, in voting
for the Fugitive Slave bill. For Massachusetts, it was
said that the passage of that bill would raise the price
of manufacturing stocks; as, for North Carolina, it
would increase the profits of negro-breeding. Here,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_556">[Pg 556]</span>
then, are cases of coalition between persons mutually
hostile on other points; and all the northern members
engaged in it, not to carry out, but to defeat, the will
of their constituents.</p>

<p>But the coalition entered into by the Free Soil party
in this state, last year, was a coalition planned, formed,
sanctioned, and executed, as far as they could execute
it, by the people themselves, acting in their original,
sovereign capacity, at their primary meetings, and at
the ballot box. It was not originated by representatives
against the wishes of their constituents; but the
representatives carried out what the people who chose
them willed. What conclusively proves this to be so
is, that the people who elected these representatives
were satisfied with what they did; and, since the work
has been done, have shown their approval of it in every
practicable way.</p>

<p>There may be wrong motives prompting to the most
useful and beneficent acts, as good motives sometimes
lead to the most pernicious conduct; but I am speaking
of these acts of alleged coalition which were instituted
by the people themselves, discussed in their
hearing at all the primary meetings and all the conventions,
and afterwards ratified by their votes; and
I say, to compare such a coalition with that which took
place between Whigs and Democrats in the Senate of
the United States, and between unionists and disunionists,
slave-breeders and manufacturers, in the House, to
carry through the compromise bills and the Fugitive
Slave bill, seems to me illogical, preposterous, and absurd.
But it is said that the bargain in the one case
was open and public; and that its terms were reduced
to writing, like a bond or covenant between individuals.
Is it any the worse for that? Had you not
as lief have an open bargain that you can see, as secret
ones, like the Texas stock bargains, that you cannot
see? I suppose that coalitions can be <i>implied</i> and<span class="pagenum" id="Page_557">[Pg 557]</span>
<i>understood</i>, as well as contracts. Why, have you not
seen such an implied coalition carried out in Faneuil
Hall within a year, when the Hon. Benjamin F. Hallett
led on his cohorts, and the Hon. Rufus Choate
advanced his forces to join them; when Mr. Benjamin
R. Curtis joined hands with Mr. David Henshaw, who
was present by letter, if not in person,—honorable
men all,—and formed one of the most loving and
harmonious coalitions out of as heterogeneous and
repulsive elements as ever chaos jumbled together,—a
coalition not to lift the bleeding form of liberty up,
but to crush it down.</p>

<p>The coalition entered into by the Free Soilers certainly
did one thing which would atone for many
errors. They elected Mr. Charles Sumner to the
Senate of the United States. And I cannot believe
there is a man to be found in any party so shameless
and depraved as to charge Mr. Sumner with any dishonorable
coalescing, or with being tainted, in a hair
of his head or in a filament of his garments, with
“bargain and corruption.” Mr. Sumner was not
elected on any principle of availability, but on the
principle of “<i>Detur digniori</i>,”—“Let it be given to
the most worthy.” His lofty pedestal is too firm to be
shaken by any such accusation. His character is not
to be affected by any office which he shall hold, but
only by what <i>he does</i>, whether in office or out of it.</p>

<p>While defending, in this way, the principle of coalitions,
when formed by the people themselves, no
one, of course, could be understood as pledging himself
to vote for all their measures. This would be
the old and wicked partisan principle of standing by
our party, right or wrong. I am also free to say that
there is, in my opinion, a <i>prima facie</i> objection against
coalitions; but I cannot doubt the existence of cases
where they are not only justifiable, but laudable. I lay
down this great principle: I think the Free Soil party<span class="pagenum" id="Page_558">[Pg 558]</span>
should act at any time, on any point, with any party
through whom they can help the cause of freedom.</p>

<p>The Whig address remarks as follows: “We are
now able to say, after the experience of nearly a
twelvemonth, that it, [the administration,] has fully
earned the confidence which we awarded to it in
advance. <i>The great interests of the country have
been faithfully cared for!</i>” I ask, What great interests
of the country have been faithfully cared for?
What interest of the Whig party, assuming to be the
country, has been faithfully cared for? Have we got
a tariff? Mr. Webster dissipated all chance of that
for the present, and I fear for years to come, when he
taught the south to threaten and prevail. Have we
any river and harbor appropriations? Alas! northern
capital and northern lives still go to the bottom on
our western waters. Is the financial policy of the
country changed? Let the condition of the money
market for the last few months, and also its prospective
condition, grinding the middle classes of tradesmen
and manufacturers as between the upper and nether
millstone, answer this question. A reform in all these
particulars would doubtless have been affected but for
Mr. Webster’s apostasy; but where are these reforms
now? If they exist at all, they exist in some indefinite
future. What interest of the country, then, has
been faithfully cared for or secured? Not one!
Not one! The most prominent member of the administration
has been engaged in carrying out the
policy of the south,—in visiting southern cities to
pander to the slave power, and northern cities to
stifle the spirit of freedom. Two armed expeditions
have been fitted out in our own ports against the
territory of a government with which we are at peace,
resulting in the loss of hundreds of lives, while the
President and his first secretary have been spending
their time gayly at watering-places. When some of<span class="pagenum" id="Page_559">[Pg 559]</span>
our citizens, a few years ago, afforded some assistance
to the “Liberals” of Canada, in favor of a movement
which Canadians themselves had already set on foot,
the government promptly and energetically interfered.
But Canada and Cuba are wider apart <i>politically</i> than
they are <i>geographically</i>. Slavery makes the difference
between them.</p>

<p>The only valorous exploit of this administration
was the issuing of a proclamation, when one southern
slave, from among three millions, escaped from the
house of bondage, and found that protection under
the British ensign which was denied to him by the
American flag, and that right to a trial by jury under
a monarchy which was denied to him by a republic.
Or, if any other act should be added to the preceding,
it was the President’s letter to Dr. Collins, of Georgia,
offering the use of the army and navy of the United
States to catch one poor white woman, Ellen Crafts,
and her husband, and return them to bondage.</p>

<p>In another passage of the Whig address all disguise
is cast off, and it is openly declared, that the giving
of an extra slave state to Texas, with territory enough
for half a dozen more as large as Massachusetts, and
ten millions of dollars in addition to that, and the
statutory permission that slavery may go into New
Mexico and Utah, and even that abhorred enactment,
the Fugitive Slave law, are only “factitious and imaginary”
grounds of complaint. The Free Soil party
is condemned because it takes any notice of such
“factitious and imaginary” causes. A three-penny
tax on tea was a real grievance,—one fit to be resisted
unto blood, to be historically recorded, and to which
we are not ashamed to refer when descanting upon
the honor of our fathers. But such largesses to slavery
as kings could not afford to give, and the robbery of
an entire race of all its rights,—yes, and with authority,
too, to make us help commit the robbery,—these<span class="pagenum" id="Page_560">[Pg 560]</span>
are “factitious and imaginary” causes of dissatisfaction.
Men of Massachusetts! moral and religious
men! lovers of freedom and of your country, were
you prepared for this?</p>

<p>But the address goes still further. It goes into an
elaborate palliation of the Fugitive Slave law itself.
It first attempts to shift the question by asking the
Free Soilers what they would do with regard to the
constitutional provision respecting escaped slaves. The
views of the Free Soil party on this point, and their
purpose of fidelity to the constitution, have been set
forth a hundred times. In further answer, therefore,
to this question, I trust it is only necessary to remark,
that the Free Soil party <i>will do what they say</i>, and
not pass ten long years in asserting, and protesting,
and resolving, and calling Earth and Heaven to witness
their devotion to Freedom, and then disavow all they
had ever avowed, and forswear their oaths.</p>

<p>Let me read to you the disparaging and contemptuous
remark of the address on that great palladium of
human liberty, the trial by jury. “Is nothing meant,”
it gravely asks, “but the substitution of the verdict
of a jury for the decision of a judge.” Nothing but—<i>what</i>?
“The verdict of a jury for the decision
of a judge,” that is, of a commissioner! And are the
persons who prepared that address so nearly stone
blind as not to recognize the infinite difference between
the verdict of a jury and the decisions of such
commissioners as Messrs. Ingraham, Smith, and Nelson?
Ingraham, of Philadelphia, sent a man into
bondage whom the alleged claimant refused to receive
as soon as he saw him, knowing that all his family,
and all his slaves, and all his neighbors would see that
he had no right to him. Smith, of Buffalo, gave a
certificate to carry Daniel into slavery, when not a
single item, or particle, or tittle of legal and admissible
evidence was before him as proof, as was afterwards<span class="pagenum" id="Page_561">[Pg 561]</span>
shown by Judge Conkling, of the United States
court. Nelson, of New York, forced the facts in
Bolding’s case to bring them within the law which
he himself had laid down, as much as ever a fraudulent
book-keeper forced balances to cover an embezzlement.
Sims, instead of having common-law notice
and time to send for evidence, was seized at night on
a false and trumped-up charge of stealing. Daniel
was knocked down by the claimant’s agent with a
club, tumbled and tortured upon a hot stove, his scalp
torn open, and then compelled to go to trial, while, as
described by an eye witness, “he sat dozing, unable
to talk with his counsel, with the blood slowly oozing
out of his mouth and nostrils.” Hamlet, Long, and
Bolding were sprung upon as remorselessly as a tiger
springs upon a lamb, and carried to trial without being
allowed to go to their respective homes to bid farewell
to their families. An alleged slave has lately been
taken from Pennsylvania who was seized in the night,
tried in the night, and carried away on the same
night, without any opportunity for preparation, for
counsel, or for defence. The kidnapper, Alberti, now
lies in a Pennsylvania prison for carrying away a
mother and her child; but the mother and the child
are now groaning under the lash of a southern taskmaster.
Had this villain, Alberti, and his accomplices
been detected while the victims were still in their
hands, I suppose he would have carried them before
Mr. Commissioner Ingraham, and had the wrong <i>legally</i>
rectified,—the blackness of the crime <i>judicially</i>
washed white. These are but specimens of what the
Fugitive Slave law has already done, before the public
mind has become familiarized with its brutalities, and
while there is yet some sensibility to the claims of
justice and mercy left among us. And yet the writer
of this address and the committee that offered it, ask
us whether all we mean is the substitution of the verdict<span class="pagenum" id="Page_562">[Pg 562]</span>
of a jury for the decision of a commissioner. I
answer, that this difference which they so be-little and
disparage will often be all the difference between freedom
and bondage, between life and death, between
honor and infamy, between happiness and perdition.</p>

<p>And now, fellow-citizens, if, in addition to having
our northern freemen kidnapped in southern ports, and
imprisoned and sold into bondage; if, in addition to
fighting for foreign territory to be added to the domain
of slavery; if, in addition to being taxed, in sums of
millions and tens of millions, to fortify the slave
power;—if, in addition to all this, we are to be deprived
and defrauded of that noble and venerable institution,
the trial by jury,—an institution sanctified by
the blood of martyrs, hallowed by the prayers of
sainted patriots, held sacred by all good men, and
taught to their children like the living oracles of God;—if
this attempt is to be made, as the late Whig address
foreshadows,—then I say, a more flagrant case of apostasy
is nowhere to be found on the records of any history,
sacred or profane, since Satan broke into paradise
and <i>Websterized</i> our first parents.</p>

<p>I shall advert to but one more point in the address.
It speaks of the “pitiable humbug of ballot envelopes.”
Now, gentlemen, I may be all wrong on this subject.
My instincts, reason, judgment, conscience, may all
mislead; but from the first time, now years ago,
when I heard this subject broached, my instincts, reason,
judgment, conscience, have all been in its favor.
Why, fellow-citizens, the ballot is worse than useless,
if it be not <span class="allsmcap">FREE</span>! Better be debarred from the privilege
of voting at all, than to be mocked with the form,
while cheated of the substance. A southern slave
stands higher, politically, than a northern laborer, if the
latter must vote as his employer dictates. It may be
very well for an opulent man, one of vast fortune, who
is dependent on nobody, and so cares for nobody, who<span class="pagenum" id="Page_563">[Pg 563]</span>
goes quarterly and takes his thousands of dollars for
rents or dividends; it may be very well for him to
laugh at the secret ballot, and call it a “humbug;” but
let us look at the other end of the scale. Let us look
in the thousands of day-laborers, of workmen on corporation
grounds, of dependent clerks, of subordinates
at custom-houses and other public offices, and so forth,
who have no capital but their industry, no resources
but their daily earnings, who have an aged mother or
dependent sisters to support, or a family of children to
be fed, clothed, and educated; who may be turned out
even of the humble tenements where they live, as
winter is coming on; who may be refused promotion
or advancement in their work and in their wages; and
in regard to some of whom the wolf of hunger sits
growling at the door; let us look at these, I say, and
then answer the question, whether they ought not to
be protected in voting according to their judgment and
conscience. The liberty of voting includes all other
liberties. The man of independent circumstances has
this liberty; and no man’s circumstances, not even the
poorest and the humblest, should be so dependent as to
take it away.</p>

<p>I do not desire this secret ballot law for myself. I
like to lay my ballot in the box, face upwards, looking
heavenward; looking the Paul Prys who hover round,
full in the eye; but I am willing and glad to put that
ballot in an envelope, in order to protect my poor neighbor,
the bread of whose mouth, the shelter of whose
family, and the education of whose children, may depend
upon the vote he gives. Ay, I go further. I
should think that any high-minded man, any man having
proper sensibilities respecting his relations to his
social inferiors, would rejoice in such a law as this;
because it would take away all ground of accusation
or imputation that he would do so unrighteous and<span class="pagenum" id="Page_564">[Pg 564]</span>
dastardly a deed as to invade a dependant’s right of
voting as it might seem to him good.</p>

<p>Gentlemen, it is said, in one of the Springfield resolutions,
that the last legislature cost the state an extra
fifty thousand dollars. Whether it did or not is not
of any very vast importance; though I confess I have
a great respect for Poor Richard’s economy, and
would save all that I could. But does not the very
mention of this sum of fifty thousand remind one of
another sum, almost precisely the same, which was
spent last year on one of Mr. Sumner’s predecessors in
the senatorial office? And if it cost fifty thousand
dollars for a ticket to pass Mr. Webster out of the Senate,
it was surely worth as much for a ticket to pass
Mr. Sumner in.</p>

<p>Gentlemen, I close by remarking that it is in view
of these great questions of human freedom,—in view
of the solemn responsibility in which we stand to our
country and to posterity, that we have assembled here
to-day. May this meeting prove to be a concentration
of rays of scattered light and wisdom, meeting and
burning in a focus, and then sending back illumination
and cheering to all the parts of our beloved commonwealth.
If, in my humble way, I can do any thing to
promote so glorious an object, my services are at your
disposal.</p>

1.A. By reading or using any part of this Project Gutenberg&#8482;
electronic work, you indicate that you have read, understand, agree to
and accept all the terms of this license and intellectual property
(trademark/copyright) agreement. If you do not agree to abide by all
the terms of this agreement, you must cease using and return or
destroy all copies of Project Gutenberg&#8482; electronic works in your
possession. If you paid a fee for obtaining a copy of or access to a
Project Gutenberg&#8482; electronic work and you do not agree to be bound
by the terms of this agreement, you may obtain a refund from the person
or entity to whom you paid the fee as set forth in paragraph 1.E.8.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
1.B. &#8220;Project Gutenberg&#8221; is a registered trademark. It may only be
used on or associated in any way with an electronic work by people who
agree to be bound by the terms of this agreement. There are a few
things that you can do with most Project Gutenberg&#8482; electronic works
even without complying with the full terms of this agreement. See
paragraph 1.C below. There are a lot of things you can do with Project
Gutenberg&#8482; electronic works if you follow the terms of this
agreement and help preserve free future access to Project Gutenberg&#8482;
electronic works. See paragraph 1.E below.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
1.C. The Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation (&#8220;the
Foundation&#8221; or PGLAF), owns a compilation copyright in the collection
of Project Gutenberg&#8482; electronic works. Nearly all the individual
works in the collection are in the public domain in the United
States. If an individual work is unprotected by copyright law in the
United States and you are located in the United States, we do not
claim a right to prevent you from copying, distributing, performing,
displaying or creating derivative works based on the work as long as
all references to Project Gutenberg are removed. Of course, we hope
that you will support the Project Gutenberg&#8482; mission of promoting
free access to electronic works by freely sharing Project Gutenberg&#8482;
works in compliance with the terms of this agreement for keeping the
Project Gutenberg&#8482; name associated with the work. You can easily
comply with the terms of this agreement by keeping this work in the
same format with its attached full Project Gutenberg&#8482; License when
you share it without charge with others.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
1.D. The copyright laws of the place where you are located also govern
what you can do with this work. Copyright laws in most countries are
in a constant state of change. If you are outside the United States,
check the laws of your country in addition to the terms of this
agreement before downloading, copying, displaying, performing,
distributing or creating derivative works based on this work or any
other Project Gutenberg&#8482; work. The Foundation makes no
representations concerning the copyright status of any work in any
country other than the United States.

phrase &#8220;Project Gutenberg&#8221; is associated) is accessed, displayed,
performed, viewed, copied or distributed:

        the use of Project Gutenberg&#8482; works calculated using the method
        you already use to calculate your applicable taxes. The fee is owed
        to the owner of the Project Gutenberg&#8482; trademark, but he has

1.F.1. Project Gutenberg volunteers and employees expend considerable
effort to identify, do copyright research on, transcribe and proofread

electronic works, and the medium on which they may be stored, may
contain &#8220;Defects,&#8221; such as, but not limited to, incomplete, inaccurate
or corrupt data, transcription errors, a copyright or other

Section 2. Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg&#8482;
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Project Gutenberg&#8482; is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of
computers including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers. It
exists because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations
from people in all walks of life.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need are critical to reaching Project Gutenberg&#8482;&#8217;s
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg&#8482; collection will
remain freely available for generations to come. In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg&#8482; and future
generations. To learn more about the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation and how your efforts and donations can help, see
Sections 3 and 4 and the Foundation information page at www.gutenberg.org.

Section 4. Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Project Gutenberg&#8482; depends upon and cannot survive without widespread
public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine-readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment. Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States. Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements. We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance. To SEND
DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any particular state
visit <a href="https://www.gutenberg.org/donate/">www.gutenberg.org/donate</a>.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States. U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Please check the Project Gutenberg web pages for current donation
methods and addresses. Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including checks, online payments and credit card donations. To
donate, please visit: www.gutenberg.org/donate

Section 5. General Information About Project Gutenberg&#8482; electronic works
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Professor Michael S. Hart was the originator of the Project
Gutenberg&#8482; concept of a library of electronic works that could be
freely shared with anyone. For forty years, he produced and
distributed Project Gutenberg&#8482; eBooks with only a loose network of
volunteer support.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Project Gutenberg&#8482; eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as not protected by copyright in
the U.S. unless a copyright notice is included. Thus, we do not
necessarily keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper
edition.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
